        "Abstract": "In the electric vehicle wireless power transfer (WPT) system, the mutual inductance coefficient (M) between the transmitting and receiving coils is an important factor influencing overall system efficiency. We reviewed a large number of research papers in this field but did not find a detailed analysis of the M. There are two contributions in this paper. First, the detailed mathematical model of the M was developed. Second, the three-dimensional spatial distribution diagram of the M was drawn using Python software, and the maximum value and its corresponding position coordinates were calculated. Then, the theoretical analysis of the M distribution in this paper was proven correct through experiments. The theoretical analysis and experimental verification of the M distribution in this paper provided a theoretical reference for the positioning requirements in the electric vehicle WPT system between the transmitting and receiving coils.",

        "Abstract": "Doubly fed induction generator (DFIG) has been frequently utilized in wind turbines due to its ability to handle variable speed operations. This study investigates the real parameters of a Mitsubishi company MWT 92/2.4 MW wind turbine model. It performs and implements grid-connected variable speed turbines, to control the active and reactive powers. Moreover, it presents a vector control strategy of DFIG for controlling the generated stator power. Meanwhile, the rotor side converter (RSC) and grid side converter (GSC) are developed separately. Proportional-Integral (PI) controller and maximum power point tracking (MPPT) algorithm are implemented to regulate the generated torque, active or reactive powers, grid voltage, stator and rotor currents. In addition, MPPT and PI controllers are compared in terms of settling time. Thus, the result demonstrates that the performance of the MPPT technique provides strong robustness and reaches steady-state much faster than the PI controller with variable parameters. To the contrary, typical PI controller gives fast response in tracking the references of DFIG magnitudes. The effectiveness of the overall system is tested by MATLAB simulation.",

        "Abstract": "This study presents the application of Coot bird behavior-based optimization algorithm (COOTBA) for optimal placement of Thyristor Controlled Series Compensator (TCSC) devices in an IEEE 30-node transmission power network with three single objectives, including fuel cost, power loss, and voltage deviation. COOTBA proves that TCSC is very useful for the power system to reduce cost and loss and improve the voltage of loads. COOTBA is implemented for the system with one case without TCSC devices and three others with TCSC. The results from the second case, only optimization of TCSC’s reactance, have better cost and voltage but worse voltage stability than the first case without TCSC devices. For the third case, with optimization of both location and reactance of TCSC devices, the cost, loss, and voltage are better than in the first case but worse than in the fourth case. The third case limits the maximum reactance of TCSC within 0 and 0.02 pu, while the fourth case expands the range. The comparisons of results from COOTBA indicate that TCSC should be optimized for both location and reactance, and the limitation of TCSC devices should be high enough. In addition, COOTBA is also compared and superior to about fifteen other previous algorithms, including original, improved, and hybrid metaheuristic algorithms. Thus, COOTBA is an effective algorithm for optimizing TCSC devices on transmission power systems.",

The predicted finite element analysis (FEA) machine parameters are: unbalanced magnetic force (UMF), total harmonic distortion (THD), torque ripple, cogging torque and static torque. It is revealed that the machine types that have odd number of rotor poles have lower undesirable machine properties such as: low cogging torque, low torque ripple and low total harmonic distortion compared to the ones that have even number of rotor poles; though, with higher amount of unbalanced magnetic force on the rotor. More so, the machine types having odd number of rotor poles would have higher air gap flux density magnitudes; and would also exhibit better average torque per magnet usage, which is desirable for reduced cost implications.",

        "Abstract": "Electromagnetic mechanisms are widely used in various systems due to the simplicity of their design and reliability in operation. One such system is the fuel injection system for an internal combustion engine. The electromagnets installed in such systems should have a number of special properties: they should have small dimensions, high speed, which is ensured by forcing, a small mass of moving elements, an increased residual air gap, a small armature stroke and minimal eddy currents in the magnetic core. The reduction of eddy currents is carried out through the use of steels with increased resistivity and special cuts in the housing and armature, which significantly complicates the design of the electromagnet, but is an effective method for reducing losses for DC electromagnetic systems. To assess the influence of the design of an electromagnet on its speed, the article present a comparative analysis of the solution of the problem of dynamics in a 3D formulation for a forced armored DC electromagnet and an improved electromagnet with reduced eddy current losses due to special structural cuts in the housing and armature.",

        "Abstract": "These Single carrier frequency division multiple access (SC-FDMA) has very low power consumption at the sender’s side, and this is one of the potential candidates for uplink in long-term evolution (LTE). The objective of this work is to explore the error probability of SC-FDMA system under sub-carrier mapping in heavily faded areas where the signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) are very low. Wireless environment with heavily faded areas includes military radio systems; direct sequence spread spectrum system (DS-SS), global positioning system (GPS) etc. The localized FDMA (LFDMA) and distributed FDMA (DFDMA) are used to compare the performances of SC-FDMA in heavily faded areas. In heavily faded area with negative signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), the SC-FDMA system is implemented using modulation and encoding methods to receive a very weak signal. Here, binary phase shift keying (BPSK), quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK), 16-PSK, quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) and 16-QAM modulation techniques are used to calculate the bit error rate (BER) performances. The results show the BER performances of SC-FDMA using mapping schemes for different channels, like, AWGN channel, Rayleigh channel, COST207TU, and COST207RA channel models for heavily faded areas. In AWGN channel, BER at -15dB is about 10 times more than BER at 15dB. The COST207 model shows that the BER is less in typical urban (TU) area compared to the rural area (RA).The performance of BPSK modulation in SC-FDMA system is better in heavily faded areas than other modulation schemes.",

        "Abstract": "Frequency response analysis offers an insight about the integrity of machine windings, when employed as a tool for condition monitoring. To ensure that, an electromagnetic wave is injected from one terminal of winding, and the power of the wave at the receiving terminal is measured. The power at the terminals is measured in terms of either voltage or current. This difference in power at the two terminals can be attributed to the medium's permittivity, permeability and conductivity, through which the signal is being transmitted. This paper offers an explanation for the behavior of the voltage gain frequency response of induction motor winding and propagating medium parameters by employing the fundamental electromagnetic wave equations. Their explanation illustrates how these parameters can affect the response. The correlation established using Maxwell's equation and these parameters with frequency response analysis is evident while identifying open winding fault and issue with machine core inductance. The results are analyzed and interpreted with the new correlation.",

        "Abstract": "Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is widely used for producing high quality imaging of Earth surface due to its capability of image acquisition in all-weather conditions. However, one limitation of SAR image is that image textures and fine details are usually contaminated with speckle noise. This noise is multiplicative and having granular pattern. It is caused due to the integration of various backscattered signals obtained during SAR image acquisition. It degrades the quality of SAR image and causes difficulty in visual interpretation. This paper presents a speckle reduction technique of SAR images based on statistical modelling of detail band shearlet coefficients (SC) in homomorphic environment. Modelling of SC obtained from log transformed noiseless SAR image are carried out as Normal Inverse Gaussian (NIG) distribution. However, SC pertaining to speckle noise are modelled as Gaussian distribution. These SC are segmented as heterogeneous, strongly heterogeneous and homogeneous regions depending upon the local statistics of SAR image. Then maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation is employed over the SC of all regions of detail bands that belong to homogenous and heterogenous category. Objective and subjective quality assessment is performed for synthetic images and real SAR images. Reference image quality metrics, PSNR and SSIM for synthetic images and non-reference image quality metrics, ENL for real SAR images signify the potential of proposed method in comparison to six existing image denoising methods.",

The detail of improvement designs of double V (2V) shape and inverter delta (VI) shape has been proposed for electric vehicles taking a high constant torque in a wide range speed into account. The torque ripple, output power and torque density are developed and evaluated in different topologies via the finite element method. The two-layered rotor structure with the 2V and VI shapes is also designed to give the suitable choices for manufacturing in mass production. For the higher torque density and efficiency, the two-layered 2V or VI magnets of IPM motor with 72 slots/8 poles can be adjusted with the sinusoidal step skewing to minimize the torque ripple, harmonic components and back electromotive force. The developed method is performed on the practical problem of the IPM motor of 200 kW-450 Nm, which is applied to the single drive system delivers.",

        "Abstract": "The purpose of this work is to develop proposals for modernizing the design of turbogenerators with a capacity of 200-300 MW in order to increase their power. To increase the power, it is proposed to increase the generator electromagnetic parameters (induction in the magnetic circuit and linear load of the generator). At the same time, the possibility of replacing hydrogen, which cools the generator internal volume, on the air was studied, which is a global trend for turbogenerators of thermal power plants with a capacity of 200-300 MW. A prerequisite was the preservation of the turbogenerator dimensions. The set goals were achieved by changing the geometry of the stator core tooth zone and intensifying cooling. To determine the necessary changes in the tooth zone with a change in the electromagnetic and thermal characteristics of the turbogenerator, a mathematical model was developed that makes it possible to determine by calculation the required dimensions and configuration of the stator slots and gas cooler elements at condition that the permissible thermal characteristics are maintained. The modelling of the stator core was carried out in order to select the dimensions of the slots and channels of axial ventilation for the required mode of the coolers operation, subject to an increase in power.",

        "Abstract": "Electric Vehicles (EVs) are gaining popularity due to their low maintenance, better performance and zero carbon emission. To expand their adoption, Electric Vehicles Charging Stations (EVCS) must be integrated with the distribution system constructively to charge EVs. This study suggests an RAO-3 based on the fuzzy classification technique for the optimum EVCS, Distributed Generations (DGs), and Shunt Capacitors (SCs) sizing and positioning for 69 bus radial distribution systems with network reconfiguration. The proposed method has the following advantages (i) lower active power loss, (ii) enhanced voltage profiles, (iii) improved power factor at the substation, and (iv) optimum distribution of EVs at charging stations. Characteristic curves of Li-Ion battery charging are utilised for load flow analysis to build EV battery charging loads models. The proposed simultaneous fuzzy multi-objective study with a reconfigured network can handle the optimal number of EVs in EVCS and maintain the substation power factor at the required level, yielding an impressive distribution system performance. For example, the minimum active power loss of 18.0884 kW is achieved with a minimum voltage enhanced to 0.9905 p.u., maintaining the bus voltages at their permissible limit. The numerical results indicate that using the RAO-3 algorithm, the simultaneous technique with system reconfiguration is computationally efficient and scalable, outperforming the two-stage methodology and the method without system reconfiguration.",

Usually, a Dual Active Bridge (DAB) converter with soft switching capability essentially matches the needs of an energy storage system. The DAB not able to reduce the inductor current stress when load is increased, and thus, the efficiency is decreased. To address this issue, we present a novel Quadruple Active Bridge (QAB) converter. In terms of enhancing the efficiency along with mitigating the current stress on the Low Voltage (LV) side, the LLC resonant converter with a constant pulse width modulation scheme was implemented. Finally, the QAB-LLC converter fed with Electric Vehicle’s (EV’s) Battery has been verified in MATLAB/Simulink and it results in a maximum State of Charge (SOC) and, maximum voltage capability which provides a high efficiency along with minimum inductor current stress on LV side.",

This method is a decentralized control strategy based on a set of neural controllers. Essentially, the large-scale power system is decomposed into a set of subsystems in which each one is constituted by a single machine connected to a variable bus. For each subsystem, a neural controller is designed to respond to a performance index. The neural controller is a feed-forward multi-layered one. Its training method is accomplished for different rates of desired terminal voltage and is based on the perturbed electrical power system model. For a single machine, the synaptic weights of corresponding neural controller are adjusted to force the machine outputs to converge into expected one obtained by the load flow program. To evaluate the performance and effectiveness of the proposed control method, it has been applied to the WSCC power system under severe operating conditions. The obtained results compared to the ones of conventional controllers proved the high quality of the proposed controller in terms of transient stability and voltage regulation of the considered electrical power system.",

        "Abstract": "Quantum-dot Cellular Automata (QCA) are preferred for realizing logic circuits at nanoscale dimensions along with a high level of integration and minimal energy consumption. Hamming code is a set of entropy codes used for error detection and correction in communication systems. Error detection and correction is carried out with the help of parity bits which are appended with the original bits. Designing a Hamming encoder in nanoscale has its own merits such as optimized area, reduced energy dissipation and lower QCA cost. This work proposes two QCA-based (7, 4) Hamming encoder designs; multilayer (proposed-1) and coplanar (proposed-2) structure with area and energy analysis. Proposed-1 encoder has achieved reduction of cell area by 12.5%, 34.58% in terms of cell count, and reduction in total energy dissipation of 26.8% when compared to reference encoder. Proposed-2 encoder has achieved reduction of 18.75% in area, 44.15% in terms of cell count, and 16.5% in total energy dissipation when compared to reference encoder. In terms of QCA cost, reduction of 12.5% is achieved in case of proposed structures. The energy dissipated in the proposed designs is less compared to reference encoder. Proposed-2 structure is more efficient compared to multilayer and reference encoder in terms of cell count, cell area and QCA cost. The QCA circuits are realized in QCADesigner and analyzed energy in QCADesigner-E.",

        "Abstract": "For a safe drive with a vehicle and better tyre life, it is important to regularly monitor the tyre damages to diagnose its condition and chose appropriate solution. This paper proposes a framework based on pattern recognition utilizing the strength of texture attributes and ensemble learning to detect the damages on the tyre surfaces. In this paper, a concatenation of the statistical and edge response based texture features derived from Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix and Local directional pattern are proposed to describe and represent the tyre surface characteristics and their variations due to any damages.  The derived features are provided to train machine learning algorithms using ensemble learning methods for a better understanding to discriminate the tyre surfaces into normal or damaged. The experiments of tyre surface classification were conducted on the tyre surface images acquired from Kaggle tyre dataset. The results demonstrated the ability of the combined texture features and ensemble learning methods in effectively analysing the tyre surfaces and discriminate them with better performance provided by adaboost and histogram gradient boosting methods.",

        "Abstract": "Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are envisioned to play a key role in the Sixth-Generation (6G) and Beyond Fifth-Generation (B5G) networks. Resolving spectrum constraints in UAV communications remains a critical issue. This article investigates Full-Duplex (FD) UAV-aided Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) to effectively utilise the scarce wireless spectrum. Specifically, exact closed-form formulas for the outage probability of FD UAV-aided NOMA have been developed. The results are validated using Monte Carlo simulation in 3GPP UMi conditions to provide practical guidelines for real-world deployment. In low transmission power regimes, the results also reveal that FD UAV-aided NOMA has a lower outage probability at the downlink Ground Users (GUs) than HD UAV-aided NOMA. At high transmit power regimes, FD UAV-aided NOMA is limited by residual SI at the UAV and interference from the UAV to the GUs. The numerical results also show that the transmission power at the UAV should be significantly lower than that at the Ground Base station (GB) to ensure low outages at the GUs.",

Breast cancer can be classified by physicians into two types: benign tumors, and malignant tumors, all of which are fatal if not treated early. Several machine-learning algorithms have been developed to help physicians make diagnostic choices, concretely a convolutional neural network is presented in this paper. The proposed system is divided into several fundamental steps. The proposed classifier is trained to distinguish between incoming tumors using a dataset of 780 images. To evaluate the classifier's performance accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are used. In the testing stage, the proposed method achieved an overall classification accuracy of 93%, 93% precision, 93% recall, and 93% F1-score.",

This paper proposes a method of searching for objects in an image, based on the identification of a cluster representation of the query descriptions and the current image of the window with the calculation of the relevance measure. The implementation of a cluster representation significantly increases the speed of identification or classification of visual objects while maintaining a sufficient level of accuracy. Based on the development of models for the analysis and processing of a set of descriptors of keypoints, we have obtained an effective method for the identification of visual objects. A comparative experiment with the traditional method has been conducted, where a linear search for the nearest descriptor was implemented for identification without using a cluster representation of the description. In the experiment, a speed gain for the developed method has been obtained in comparison with the traditional one by approximately 5.2 times with the same level of accuracy. The method can be used in applied tasks where the time of object identification is critical. The developed method can be applied to search for several objects of different classes. The effectiveness of the method can be increased by varying the values of its parameters and adapting to the characteristics of the data.",

In this paper, a novel feature design methodology is proposed to represent images efficiently for Content Based Image Retrieval (CBIR). Generally, local patterns are computed directly on images and hence, directional information of the images is ignored. In the proposed feature, Kirsch operators are used to highlight eight major directional changes in the image and further, Kirsch Ternary Local Pattern (KLTP) is extracted by analysing local intensity variations in the neighbourhood. In KLTP, global color information is also incorporated to make it robust and perform well on variety of images. Experiments on natural and texture databases are done to verify the performance, as compared to the available features in the literature.",

The fiber optic splitter takes a small portion of the optical power sufficient for the eavesdropper to read the data and lets as much signal power as possible pass in the original direction. We attempted to detect the presence of fiber optic splitter-based eavesdropping points on the communication line by using common techniques designated for fiber optic quality measurement and fault detection. The results are summarised in this paper.",

A total of 4-input data streams are multiplexed before being transmitted through RoFSO link. A 4 x 20 Gbps data rate is achieved by performing multiplexing at SCM level with 45 GHz, 60 GHz subcarrier frequencies and then at MDM level with HG01 and LG10 optical modes. With certain design enhancements, channel capacity can be further increased to multi-fold levels. The performance of transmitted input data streams 1-4 is investigated for Bit Error Rate (BER), Q-factor, received signal power, SNR and turbulence conditions under clear air, haze, rain, fog and dust conditions. Eye diagram and electric constellation patterns are analyzed for reliable data transmission. Thus, by using proposed design with 2-level multiplexing, a higher transmission capacity and low crosstalk levels are easily achieved.",

This strategy uses real-time estimation and compensation of the generalized \"total\" disturbance before it affects the system. The wind farm supervisory unit is used to coordinate the control of the powers production by the entire wind farm, which must take into account the couplings between each wind generator while producing the individual power commands. The turbine control units (local supervisory units) send the appropriate power references depending on the situation. This can be to produce the maximum power, to manage the active and reactive power given by the Transmission System Operator (TSO) or to meet the requirements of the grid code (LVRT capacity). However, to ensure the dispatching of the references of the active and reactive powers over the all wind generators of the wind farm and to satisfy the security of the power grid, we utilized mean of the proportional distribution algorithm. \r\nThe effectiveness of the proposed supervisory approach and control strategies are tested and validated through a multiples scenarios of simulations that are made under the MATLAB/Simulink Environment. The results obtained have demonstrated the efficiency and robustness of the control methods, and also the fact that they guarantee good performance and safety of the integration of wind farms into the grid while complying with the requirements of the grid code during power system faults.",

        "Abstract": "The tailpipe emission caused by the vehicles using internal combustion engines is a significant source of air pollution. To reduce the health hazards caused by air pollution, advanced countries are now adopting the use of Electric Vehicles (EVs). Due to the advancement of electric vehicles, research and development efforts are being made to improve the performance of EV motors. With a nominal reference stator flux, the classical induction motor drive generates significant flux, torque ripple, and current harmonics. In this work, a Teamwork Optimization Algorithm (TOA)-based optimal stator flux strategy is suggested for torque ripple reduction applied in a Classical Direct Torque Controlled Induction Motor (CDTC-IM) drive. The suggested algorithm's responsiveness is investigated under various steady-state and dynamic operating conditions. The proposed Direct Torque Controlled Induction Motor (DTC-IM) drive's simulation results are compared to those of the CDTC-IM and Fuzzy Direct Torque Controlled Induction Motor (FDTC-IM) drives. The proposed system has been evaluated and shown to have reduced torque ripple, flux ripple, current harmonics, and total energy consumption by the motor. Further, a comparative simulation study of the above methods at different standard drive cycles is presented. Experimental verification of the proposed algorithm using OPAL-RT is presented. The results represent the superiority of the proposed algorithm compared to the CDTC- and FDTC-IM drive. The torque ripple reduction approach described in this study can also be applied to all types of induction motors, not only those for electric vehicles or Hybrid Electric Vehicles (HEVs).",

The torque ripple produced in DFIG due to loading by grid tied inverter, which leads to poor power quality injection into the system. Also, these ripples transferred by DC link and causes heating losses and generator phase current distortion. Therefore, this paper modelled ANN based control scheme to reduce the torque ripple content and restrict the transfer of ripple by DC link to improve the outcome of wind energy system while operating in variable conditions. The DFIG system under studied are modelled and simulated in MATLAB SIMULINK to verify the improvement using proposed control strategy. The recent control technique is also simulated for reflecting the effectiveness in the proposed control method. The outcomes obtained are studied and analysed with the existing control scheme to highlight the improvement obtained by proposed control.",

The proposed algorithm can be used for backup protection of transmission systems with any shunt and series-type FACTS devices. The increased number of FACT compensators affects the reliable operation of primary and backup protection of the transmission lines. Both shunt and series compensated lines cause malfunctioning of existing backup protection schemes. The proposed algorithm utilizes the sequence components of bus voltages and active power differential signals of lines to identify the faulty line. The algorithm is validated on a modified 9-bus system under MATLAB/SIMULINK platform. It is observed that the algorithm is suitable for identifying a faulty line in transmission systems containing both uncompensated and compensated lines with series or shunt-type FACTS controllers. This algorithm has the advantage that it uses a generalized backup protection logic and can be used for the accurate identification of a faulty line irrespective of the type of compensation devices.",

        "Abstract": "The smart grid is an intelligent power system network that should be reliable and resilient for sustainable operation. Wide-Area Measurement Systems (WAMS) are deployed in the power grid to provide real-time situational awareness to the power grid operators. An excellent strategy for exploiting the WAMS data effectively is to extract relevant insights from the increasing volume of data collected. Feature extraction techniques are pivotal in developing data-driven models for power systems. This paper proposes an ensemble feature extraction method for developing intelligent data-driven models for transmission line fault detection and classification. A comparative efficacy analysis of the proposed ensemble feature extraction method is carried out with state-of-the-art feature extraction methods. The models developed and evaluated with the feature data derived with the proposed method give an accuracy of 100% for fault detection and 99.78% for fault classification. This method also has the advantage of significantly reducing training and testing time. Features are extracted from the WAMS data collected by simulating an IEEE39 bus test system in the PowerWorld simulator.",

        "Abstract": "Power loss in the Distribution System (DS) is often higher than that of other parts of the power system because of its low voltage level. Therefore, reducing losses is always an important task in design and operation of the DS. This paper aims to apply a new approach based on Artificial Ecosystem Optimization (AEO) for the Distributed Generation Placement (DGP) and combination of DGP and network REConfiguration (DGP-REC) problems to reduce power loss of the DS to satisfy the technical constraints including power balance, radial topology, voltage and current bounds, and DG capacity limit. The AEO is a recent algorithm that has no special control parameters, inspired from the behaviours of living organisms in the ecosystem including production, consumption, and decomposition. The efficiency of the AEO is evaluated on two test systems including the 33-node and 119-node systems. The numerical results validated on the 33-node and 119-node systems show that DGP-REC is a more effective solution for reducing power loss compared to the DGP solution. In addition, evaluation results on small and large systems also indicate that AEO is an effective approach for the DGP and DGP-REC problems.",

In this paper, machine learning model such as linear regression model is used to forecast the active power load one hour and one day ahead. Real time active power load data to train and test the machine learning model is collected from a 33/11 kV substation located in Telangana State, India. Based on the simulation results, it is observed that linear regression model can forecast the load with less mean absolute error i.e. 0.042 with training data and 0.045 with testing data in comparison with support vector regressor model for an hour ahead operation. Whereas in the case of the day ahead operation, linear regression model can forecast the load with less mean absolute error i.e. 0.055 with training data and 0.057 with testing data in comparison with support vector regressor model. A platform independent web application is developed to help the operators of the 33/11 kV substation which is located in Godishala, Telangana State, India.",

        "Abstract": "The essential purpose of an energy system is to provide electricity to its loads effectively and economically, as well as safely and reliably. Therefore, the solutions to the problems of Optimal Power Flow (OPF) and Optimal Reactive Power Dispatch (ORPD) to enable the efficient employment of various energy distributions should be found. Our work focuses on the ORPD issue; it can be formulated as a non-linear constraint and with single or multiple objectives optimization problems. Minimizing total losses is one of the main objective functions to solve the ORPD problem. This paper presents the use of an improved particle swarm optimization -with a disturbance term- (called PSO-DT) algorithm, to find the solution of ORPD in the standard IEEE 30-bus power system for reducing electrical power transmission losses. The obtained results demonstrate that the proposed method is more efficient and has a more extraordinary ability to get better solutions compared to the basic PSO method.",

        "Abstract": "The application of Electric Vehicles (EVs) is increasing in many countries, causing many researchers to focus on EV Rapid Charging Station (RCS) related issues. The optimal planning of RCS considering only distribution networks is not a reliable approach. Moreover, the RCS location should be convenient to the EV user in a given EV driving range and the performance of the distribution system. In this paper, a multi-objective approach for optimal planning of RCS and Distributed Generators (DG) in a distributed system coupled with a transportation network is analyzed. The proposed optimal planning method aims to achieve reduced active power loss, EV user costs, and voltage deviation for effective RCS and DG planning. The approach includes the analysis of the test system with the base case, solo planning of RCS, planning of DGs with fixed RCS, and simultaneous optimal planning of RCS and DGs. Daily load variation at buses and hourly charging probability of EVs have been used in the analysis. IEEE 33 bus distribution system superimposed with a 25-node transportation network is considered the test system. Rao 3 algorithm is applied for optimization, and the results have been compared with PSO and JAYA algorithms.",

        "Abstract": "The prime purpose of placing a capacitor bank in a power system is to provide reactive power, reduce power losses, and enhances voltage profile. The main challenge is to determine the optimum capacitor position and size that reduces both system power losses and the overall cost of the system with rigid constraints. For this purpose, different optimization techniques are used, for example Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) which converges the complex non-linear problem in a systematic and methodological way to find the best optimal solution. In this paper, the standard IEEE 33-bus and 69-bus systems are used to find the optimum location and size of the capacitors bank. These power networks are simulated in Siemens PSS®E software. For the optimum solution of capacitor banks, the PSO algorithm is used. The PSO fitness function is modelled in such a way which contains the high average bus voltage, the small size of capacitor banks, and low power losses. The fitness function used is a weighted type to reduce the computation time and multi-objective function complexity.",

Wind turbine generator intermittency may be mitigated by Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS), which have emerged as a viable option in recent years. To find the best position and capacity for wind power generation and BESS charging/discharging dispatches, a Red Fox Optimisation (RFO) algorithm is used while optimising the imbalanced distribution network’s performance under technological restrictions. The charging or discharging criteria for this method is the average feeder load. The charging techniques for BESS using WTG and Sustainable Average Load (SAL) are evaluated in terms of the free-running mode of dispatch cycle. The suggested approach is tested on an IEEE-37 bus Unbalanced Radial Distribution Network (UDN). It has been shown that the suggested method enhances several performance objectives of the distribution system.",

        "Abstract": "The safety and reliability of an electrical network depend on the performance of the protections utilized. Therefore, the optimal coordination of the protective devices plays an essential role. In this paper, a new algorithm, Equilibrium Optimizer (EO), which is based on the physical equation of the mass balance, is implemented in the problem of the Optimal Coordination of Directional Overcurrent Relays (DOCRs). Moreover, the proposed method uses Linear Programming (LP), Nonlinear Programming (NLP) and Mixed-Integer Nonlinear Programming (MINLP) in order to optimize the Time Dial Setting (TDS), as well as the Plug Setting (PS), satisfying all possible constraints. Additionally, the performance of EO is evaluated using several benchmarks with different topologies. The results demonstrated the applicability and efficacy of the proposed approach. A comparison with other studies reported in specialized literature is provided to demonstrate the benefits of the proposed approach.",

        "Abstract": "The uncertainty of the non-conventional sources especially solar energy caused due to spatio-temporal factors like temperature, pressure, relative humidity etc. is continuously disrupting the productivity and reliability of an integrated power system which motivates the researcher or energy industry for strategic forecasting solutions to enhance the proper scheduling and control of solar generation power plants. Several studies have been carried out; but still the objective of achieving accurate forecasting dependent on the spatio-temporal features is not achieved. To address this critical forecasting issue in this research article a hyper parametric tuning of the Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) machine learning model has been carried out using two met heuristic algorithms: Moth Flame Optimization (MFO) and Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO). The dataset comprises five years of metrological attributes collected from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) for analysis. The validation of the proposed model has been done based on the five statistical errors: Max Error (ME), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Coefficient of Determination (R^2), Mean Square Error (MSE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). The regressive assessment of all three models has confirmed that the XGB-MFO model outperformed the others as showing the highest R^2 score of 0.9337, 0.9011, 0.8744 and lowest RMSE values of 76.29 Wcm^{-2}, 41.90 Wm^{-2} and 95.94Wm^{-2} for Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI), Diffuse Horizontal Irradiance (DHI) and Direct Normal Irradiance (DNI) respectively which ensures the proposed model implementation for the prediction and production of solar power.",

        "Abstract": "Power system networks are one of the most widely used methods in the real world for transferring large amounts of electrical energy from one location to another. At present, High Voltage Direct Current Transmission is preferred for long distances over hundreds of miles due to minimal power loss and transmission cost of transmission.Due to an increase in power demand, integration of renewable sources to minimise the voltage fluctuations and compensate for power loss is necessary. This is a mandatory requirement to produce sophisticated protection methods for mainly smart systems under various balanced and unbalanced fault conditions. The system protection scheme must respond as quickly as possible to protect the connected devices in a smart environment. The network must be monitored and protected under various weather conditions as well as electrical parametric problems. The proposed research work is carried on the basis of physical monitoring with the aid of the Internet-of-Things and electrical parameters calibrated with the help of wavelet analysis. A wavelet is a mathematical tool to investigate the behaviour of transient signals at different frequencies, which provides important information related to the detailed analysis of faults in power networks. The major goals of this research are to analyse faults using detailed coefficients of current signals through the bior-1.5 mother wavelet for fault identification and artificial neural network analysis for fault localization. This proposed approach furnishes an IoT supervised Photovoltaic - High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) combined wide area power network security scheme using wavelet detailed coefficients under various types of faults with Fault-Inception-Angles.",

        "Abstract": "The signaling resources expended and the power consumed by User Equipments (UEs) in the Location Management (LM) procedures are expected to be higher in Fifth Generation (5G) than in legacy wireless communications networks. To mitigate this challenge, this work proposes a hybrid scheme that mitigates the signaling resources expended in paging and RAN-based Notification Area Update (RNAU) procedures in 5G. The approach utilizes a hybrid scheme that embeds a UE Identifier (UEID) partitioning scheme that directional pages UEs into a gNB-based UE Mobility Tracking (UEMT) scheme. The approach configures a gNB in an RRC_Inactive state to beam sweep a UEs last registered cell area before directionally paging the UE. The approach proposed in this work is implemented on a modified network architecture to reduce the signaling resources expended on both paging and RNAU of UEs at higher frequencies which is an enabling factor for mmWave systems. Simulation results of the total accumulated cost of paging showed a 65.13 % and 8.69 % reduction in signaling resources expended against the conventional approach and the existing gNB-based UEMT approach, respectively. Additionally, the total accumulated resources expended in both procedures over 24 hours showed that the modified gNB-based UEMT scheme outperformed the conventional scheme and the gNB-based UEMT scheme by 90.96 % and 38.36 %, respectively.",

        "Abstract": "The neurobiological origin of dyslexia allows the study of this disorder by examining functional connectivity between regions of the brain. During rest-state or at task completion, Electroencephalograms (EEG) are used to observe brain signals. By using Partial Directed Coherence (PDC) analysis, the correct analysis of functional connectivity was assessed. In spite of that, the estimation of functional connectivity can be inaccurate due to the presence of artifacts. Several methods have been employed by researchers to remove artifacts, including Moving Average Filters (MAF), Wiener Filters (WF), Wavelet Transforms (WT), and hybrid filters. Despite this, no research has been conducted on the effects of artifact removal methods on functional connectivity. Consequently, Artifact Cancellation (AC) algorithms are developed to reduce the effects of eye blinks, eye movements, and muscle movements on functional connectivity estimation. In this work, the denoising filters discussed earlier are utilized as part of the AC algorithm. Additionally, a comparison was conducted to determine the effectiveness of the filters. According to the results, AC-MAF removed all artifacts with the least computational complexity after improving the MAF. In order to test its efficacy in real-world conditions, it was applied to the real signals recorded while children with dyslexia were participating in rapid automatized naming activities. Utilizing the PDC approach, the developed algorithm accurately assessed functional connectivity.",

        "Abstract": "Protective relays are installed in generation, transmission, and distribution system for detection, classification, and estimation of faults. To match the  future load demand and to get uninterrupted power supply, use of renewable energy sources are increasing day by day. Faults can occur in transmission lines, transformers, generators, and busbars but the nature of these faults may change many times when renewable energy sources are considered. This research paper introduce techniques to detect and classify different faults on transmission line in the presence of wind energy sources using efficient tools of artificial intelligence. The main challenges of the system fault detection, in presence of wind turbine lie in their non-linearity, uncertainty and unknown disturbances. PSCAD/EMTDC software tool is used to simulate the power system model with RES which is implemented in MATLAB and Python software. Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms have been used to classify and detect faults on transmission lines connected with wind energy source. The proposed technique has been validated for internal faults on transmission line and external faults on power system. In total of 4320 internal and external fault cases with wide variation in system parameters have been used for validation of the proposed model. The proposed model gives an overall fault zone identification accuracy of more than 99% in presence of wind energy source. The results obtained from validation show that the performance of SVM classifier is better than ANN in term of efficacy and classification time.",

        "Abstract": "This paper proposes a super-twisting sliding mode control for a multifunctional system that includes a Photovoltaic (PV) system connected to the grid through the Active Power Filter (APF). The latter is implemented to improve the power quality in the grid side, and injecting the provided photovoltaic power into the grid. Sliding mode control is known as a powerful control with good performance in transient and steady-state conditions. In this work, a Super-Twisting Sliding Mode Control (ST-SMC) is applied to extract the maximum power from the PV source, corresponding to the irradiation level, as well as to the three-phase inverter-based-APF power control. For the system to inject the generated power from the PV source into the grid with respect to the international standards, fulfilling the active power filtering, synchronous reference frame theory is used to generate the appropriate reference signals for harmonic and reactive power compensation. To test the multi-functionality of the system (PV-APF), this one is connected to a grid supplying nonlinear loads that absorb non-sinusoidal currents. Through the simulation results, it has successfully achieved the multi-functionality of the proposed system under steady-state and dynamic conditions. The results also show the effectiveness and moderation of the proposed super-twisting sliding mode control. Furthermore, a comparative study has been established over the conventional PI controller, showing the clear superiority of the proposed control in every aspect.",

        "Abstract": "Improving the behavior of speed control in electric vehicles is currently a major challenge for researchers and engineers. For this study, we chose the context of a Switched Reluctance Motor (6/4 SRM) used in a hybrid Electric Vehicle with Extended Range (EREV). Speed regulation is an essential feature on long-distance trip. Speed regulators of backstepping type are very effective in this context given the non-linear nature of switched reluctance motors. The estimation of non-linear quantities, flux and inductance, uses Legendre polynomials. The control strategy uses four regulators, one for speed and three for stator currents. It is based on the Torque Sharing Function (TSF) and the Torque Inverse Model (TIM). Our simulation consists of studying the behavior of this type of control when an Inter-Turn Short-Circuit (ITSC) fault appears on one of the phases of the 6/4 SRM. In this paper, we are interested in temporal behavior of phasic currents and we will show the interest of these quantities as fault indicators allowing the real time diagnosis of this type of controller-machine.",

The proposed linear precoding method is aimed to increase resilience to the multipath propagation issues and reduce the Peak-to-Average Power Ratio (PAPR) of the transmitted signal. Moreover, the chaotic waveform enables novel timing synchronization methods to be implemented in the receiver. The modelling of baseband Linear Precoded OFDM (LP-OFDM) data transmission system with Rayleigh channel has been performed in Simulink environment to validate the proposed method and to compare the performance to the classic precoding methods, such as Walsh-Hadamard Transform (WHT). Experiments have shown that in a high Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) scenario, the employment of the novel precoding scheme allows reducing Bit Error Ratio (BER) by several dB compared to non-precoded OFDM. The proposed precoding method leads to the reduction of PAPR; however, it is not as efficient as classical precoding schemes, such as WHT. Experimental evidence of synchronization of the chaotic oscillators within 50 samples long time interval is presented.",

MOS Current Mode Logic (MCML) based implementations with rapid response and simultaneous generation of complemented output is all set to become indispensable in nano regime industry. This paper attempts to optimize and address performance-based analysis of digital circuits namely NAND, D flipflop and 3-bit asynchronous counter by practicing MCML based implementation. These circuits are contemplated on four design parameters namely delay (t_p), power (pwr), Power Delay Product (PDP) and Energy Delay Product (EDP). This research focuses on relative analysis and emanate a salient optimal application of Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (CMOS) and Carbon Nanotube Field Effect Transistor (CNFET) based 3-bit asynchronous counter. In addition to this, the two configurations of the MCML counter are then compared against applied V_DD at 16-nm technology nodes using HSPICE simulator. CNFET based 3-bit MCML counter is observed to be much faster (9.75x), significant improvement in gross power dissipation (11.93x), material refinement in PDP and EDP (116.39x and 1165x) respectively as compared to the conventional counterpart. Therefore, CNFET based implementations comes to the fore as resilient technology supporting high level integration in nano scale regime.",

        "Abstract": "In the prominent era of the digital world and Very Large-Scale Integration (VLSI) circuits, Static Random Access Memory (SRAM) provides a vital contribution to low-power and high-speed performance. Sense Amplifiers (SA) are a part of Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (CMOS) memories used to read the stored information. This paper indicates a Dual-Voltage, Dual-Tail Level Restoration Voltage Latch Sense Amplifier (DVDTLR-VLSA). The design has been implemented using the LT SPICE tool at 180nm technology node with a 1.8V supply. Performance comparison of existing SA presented in literature with the proposed SA is examined based on different parameters like power, energy, delay, and current. The proposed design maintains power at 2.167uW that is decreased to half as against Dual Switch Transmission Gate Voltage SA (DTGVSA) and shows an appreciable depletion. Also, the current and delay results are improved. Dimensional analysis is also done for the proposed SA to examine the performance. After that, the effect of sleep transistors on the proposed SA examines the performance in comparison to delay and power parameters without sleep transistors. The DVDTLR-VLSA has minimal energy and power. Also, the delay is improved which may be determined more advisable for low-power operations.",

        "Abstract": "Wireless communication is a fast-growing industry and recent developments focus on improving certain aspects of the area and reducing the power consumption while maintaining the frequency of operation. Phase Locked Loop (PLL) is an integral part of communication circuits which operate at very high frequencies. Phase Frequency Detector (PFD) is the first block of PLL and is key in determining the computational capacity of the PLL. The power consumption of the PFD has to be reduced to minimize the overall power consumption of PLL. The PFD architecture used is based on Double Edged Triggered D Flip-Flop (DET-DFF), which is free of dead zone. Stack, LECTOR, AVLS and hybrid low-power approaches are implemented to reduce the power consumption of DET-DFF based PFD architectures. The PFDs power, delay and power delay product analysis is performed using Cadence Virtuoso and Spectre in CMOS 180nm and 90nm technology. A power reduction of up to 32% has been observed while keeping the transistor count to a minimum.",

        "Abstract": "This work presents the quadrature sinusoidal oscillator using two Voltage Differencing-Differential Input Buffered Amplifiers (VD-DIBAs), two resistors, and two capacitors. The VD-DIBA is an electronically controllable active building block with high input and low output impedances that can connect to other circuits directly without the buffers. With these distinguished features, the VD-DIBA is employed in this design. The proposed oscillator can produce two sine waves with a phase shift of 90 degrees. Over the entire tuning frequency range, the magnitude of the quadrature output voltages is constant. The proposed oscillator is independently adjustable in terms of frequency and oscillation condition. Moreover, the frequency of oscillation can be electronically and linearly adjusted by the bias currents. The condition of oscillation is adjustable by resistors, R_1 and R_2. The performances of the proposed quadrature oscillator are tested through the PSpice simulation and the experiment. In the simulation, the VD-DIBA is built from the 0.18um Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) CMOS process with +-0.9V supply voltages. In the experiment, the VD-DIBA is implemented using the commercial ICs, LM13700, and AD830 with +-5V supply voltages. The simulated Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) values of the output voltages, V_o1 and V_o2 at f_0 = 1.03MHz are 1.63% and 1.81%, respectively. The experimental THD values of the output voltages, V_o1 and V_o2 at f_0 = 536.6kHz, are 1.43% and 1.00%, respectively.",

During the recording of these signals taken from the skin surface through non-invasive processes, analysis of the signal becomes difficult due to the electrodes attached to the skin not fully contacting, involuntary body movements, and noises from peripheral muscles. In addition, parameters such as age and skin structure of the subjects can also affect the signal. Considering these negative factors, a new adaptive method based on Extended Kalman Filtering (EKF) model for more effective filtering of the muscle signals based on both EMG and MEMS is proposed in this study. Moreover, the accuracy of the parametric values determined by the filter automatically according to the most effective time and frequency features that represent noisy and filtered signals was determined by different machine learning and classification algorithms. It was verified that the filter performs adaptive filtering with 100% effectiveness with Linear Discriminant.",

        "Abstract": "From the beginnings of ITU-T H.261 to H.265 (HEVC), each new video coding standard has aimed at halving the bitrate at the same perceptual quality by redundancy and irrelevancy reduction. Each improvement has been explained by comparably small changes in the video coding toolset. This contribution aims at starting the Quality of Experience (QoE) analysis of the accumulated improvements over the last thirty years. Based on an overview of the changes in the coding tools, we analyze the changes in the quantized residual information. Visual comparison and statistical measures are performed and some interpretations are provided towards explaining how irrelevancy reduction may have led to such a huge reduction in bitrate. The interpretation of the results in terms of QoE paves the way towards an understanding of the coding tools in terms of visual quality. It may help in understanding how the irrelevancy reduction has been improved over the decades. Understanding how the differences of the residuals relate to known or yet unknown properties of the human visual system, may enable a closer collaboration between perception research and video compression research.",

        "Abstract": "Microgrids are able to dispatch power to distribution systems with the advancement of power electronics-based inverters. As per IEEE-1547-2018 standards, Microgrid has to maintain voltage of 0.88 < V < 1.1 p.u (per unit) and frequency of 58.8< f_0 < 61.2 Hz and detect un-intentional faults in less than 2 seconds to bring Microgrid into islanding mode seamlessly. Unless these faults are detected and Microgrid is islanded, the system stability cannot be maintained and Microgrid cannot feed the connected loads. To detect these unsymmetrical faults, to bring the Microgrid to islanding mode and to be stable during non-islanding cases like loads switch on and throw off at Point of Common Coupling (PCC), a passive islanding detection method, Rate Of Change Of Voltage Phase Angle (ROCOVPA) is proposed. The methodology is simple. First, the voltage phase angle of generator bus and the grid is monitored. Then, absolute value is found and finally differentiated to get ROCOVPA and detect islanding. Also, this technique is compared with the widely used method of Rate Of Change Of Frequency (ROCOF) at different percentage active and reactive power mismatches. It also avoids nuisance tripping so that Microgrid's stability is maintained. This method is tested for un-symmetrical double line fault, for islanding cases and switch on or throw off, for non-islanding cases with linear and non-linear loads. In this method, the power quality is also not affected because of no perturbations during testing and the Non-Detection Zone (NDZ) is almost zero. The proposed method is verified by simulating islanding and non-islanding conditions in MATLAB/Simulink and by comparing with ROCOF method and found effective.",

        "Abstract": "The paper proposes a novel Optimum Frequency AC (OFAC) transmission system for reducing investment and operational cost of Electric System (ES) - integrating Offshore Wind Farm (OWF) to the onshore grid. Optimum operational frequency for ES is an inherent characteristic of the trade-off between its investment and operational cost. The paper presents a comprehensive methodology for the design of ES based on Life Cost Analysis using a Generic Algorithm. For the given offshore wind farm, alternative designs for ES are generated for different operational frequencies. Power system components of standard ratings are used for the designs. All the designs are evaluated in terms of~Net Present Values (NPV) and the design with maximum NPV is selected as the optimum solution. For 200 MW OWF, optimum operational frequencies are obtained as 50, 35, 25, and 50/3 Hz for offshore distances of 50, 100, 150, and 200 km, respectively. The results show that for 200 MW the feasible range for OFAC is 100-150 km and provides the saving of 5-10% as compared to High Voltage AC (HVAC) and Low-Frequency AC (LFAC). The results further indicate that for large-scale wind farms the saving increases substantially and the feasible range is reduced. It concludes that OFAC is an economical alternative to HVAC and LFAC for integrating large-scale OWF to the onshore grid and provides a new dimension for promoting Offshore Wind Power Plant (OWPP).",

        "Abstract": "The overall efficacy of power distribution is reduced through power loss in distribution systems owing to branch resistance. For providing quality power to customers, power losses must be diminished, and voltages must be enhanced. This paper introduces a novel improvement for the traditional Salps Swarm Algorithm (SSA) called Enhance SSA (ESSA) for selecting Optimal Shunt Capacitor Ratings and their Locations (OSCRL). ESSA is viewed as an enhanced version of SSA with the aim of improving the SSA's poor performance. A multi-objective function was designed in this work for reducing real power loss and Total System Cost (TSC), as well as, improving feeder voltage profile and maximizing Net Savings (NSs) per year under security restrictions. For validating and evaluating the proposed ESSA technique, a practical 33-bus local Iraqi and standard IEEE 69-bus Radial Distribution Systems (RDSs) were used as test systems through utilizing MATLAB. The experimental results attained by the proposed ESSA are compared with other approaches currently available in the literature for addressing OSCRL problem. The experimental results prove the efficacy and supremacy of the ESSA to other literature algorithms with respect to diminishing power loss as well as TSC, reinforce bus voltage profile and increase NSs per year for multiple RDSs.",

In general, an Energy Storage System (ESS) can offset the intermittency of renewable energy. However, ESS can absorb large amounts of energy with slow dynamics, but can only absorb fast dynamics when subjected to high currents, which quickly contributes to their wear. To avoid this, SCs are added to energy storage as a supplement to batteries. There are various methods for power-sharing, including the most common, which uses the Low-Pass Filter (LPF). This article proposes a new technique to distribute power between the battery and the SCs using the zero-compensator filter of the battery regulator. Also, this technique is based on the compensation of the energy dissipated by the battery through the SCs. Besides, the State of Charge (SoC) of the battery is kept within safe boundaries. The proposed technique is compared to the ESS and classical HESS techniques. The simulation results confirmed the efficacy of the proposed method of rapidly restoring the DC-link voltage and improving the battery lifespan. In addition, this technique is adaptable to the stand-alone site, and the AC currents showed good quality.",

        "Abstract": "In This paper, a simple single-dimension Space Vector Modulation (SVM) technique is introduced to implement on three-phase thirteen-level Modified Packed U-Cell (MPUC) inverter for photovoltaic system in which many DC sources are available. The three-phase thirteen-level converter consists of three single-phase seven-level MPUCs that each phase has six switches and two isolated DC sources. One major advantage of proposed method is to produce an output voltage with nearly constant amplitude in desired range in case of input DC voltage fluctuations, which is common in renewable sources like Photovoltaic Systems (PV). On the other hand, the conventional Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) strategies do not have such capability. Thus, the converter behavior is investigated for the proposed control method and Level Shift PWM (LS-PWM) and it is shown that the LS-PWM method does not function properly when the DC voltage varies. In order to produce an output voltage with seven equal levels, which results in reduction of the switching losses and Total Harmonic Distortion (THD), it is necessary to trigger switches in proper way. Consequently, two switching patterns are introduced and the significant decrease in power loss due to the second switching pattern is shown. Furthermore, it is investigated that in three-phase mode, the 3rd order line-voltage harmonics are eliminated well and the voltage and current THD are further improved by the proposed method. To validate the proposed SVM technique, MATLAB Simulink simulation results are presented and a comparative analysis is done between the proposed method and LS-PWM.",

One of the common approaches is broadcasting in VANET (Vehicular Ad hoc NETwork). In VANET, broadcast can be used to exchange information between several types of nodes, especially between vehicles, but also Road Side Units (RSUs). However, the most important is to ensure the exchange of information between the vehicles. This article introduces design and implementation of a new solution to broadcast in these networks between vehicles only.

Linear Regression Method is used to categorize the attention to either low or high level with a dynamic threshold, yielding a 1-bit code. The control of the motions in the algorithm is structured with two control layers. The first layer provides control with eye-blink signals, the second layer with both eye-blink and sensed attention levels. EEG signals are extracted and processed using a single channel NeuroSky MindWave 2 device. The proposed algorithm has been validated by experimental testing of five individuals of different ages. The results show its high performance compared to existing algorithms with an accuracy of 91.85% for 9 control commands. With a capability of up to 16commands and its high accuracy, the algorithm can be suitable for many applications.",

        "Abstract": "Electric Vehicles (EVs) are a promising alternative to conventional vehicles powered by internal combustion motors, of fering the possibility of reducing CO2, pollutants, and noise emissions. As known, the control of such an electric vehicle takes into account several phenomena governing its behavior, which is a complicated problem because of the non-linearities, unmeasured disturbance, and parameters uncertainty of this system. This problem is one of the important challenges facing controller designers. Various control techniques have been proposed to enhance EV’s performance. On this basis, in this research, a new synergetic scheme of electric vehicles propelled by Six-Phase Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor (PMSMs) is developed. The synthesis of the proposed Synergetic Controller (SC) is based on the selection of four-manifolds of stator current of PMSMs. The SC provides fast response, asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system in wide range operating condition, and decrease the size of modeled system. Also, the principal feature of SC is that it supports parameters variation. Furthermore, to illustrate the improvements and the performances of the proposed controller, a comparison study between various nonlinear controllers such as Integral Action in Sliding Mode (ISMC), Super Twisting Sliding Mode (STSM), using a dynamic model of the lightweight vehicle under New European Driving Cycle (NEDC) was done. The obtained simulation results under several operating conditions show the efficiency and superiority of the proposed control compared with nonlinear controllers; also, it demonstrates the feasibility of the proposed control approach for real systems.",

        "Abstract": "5G networks are started to be deployed in urban areas in the dynamic spectrum sharing mode. Therefore, the analysis of Non-Line-of-Sight (NLOS) shadowing effects behind buildings of different heights becomes particularly important. The shadowing of GSM (900 MHz), UMTS (2100 MHz) and LTE (1800 MHz) technologies was investigated in the urban area. The results are examined by using the log-normal path loss model and four different stochastic equations, specifically: normal, log-normal, Rayleigh, and Nakagami. The results showed that the fluctuations of path losses in the urban area correspond to the model of log-normal path losses. However, path losses for individual buildings do not fit this model. Therefore, stochastic methods were used to analyse shadowing effects. A path loss model based on a differential stochastic equation was proposed. This model includes the following values: free space losses, path losses disturbance due to the shadowing effect, standard deviation σ, and a freely chosen parameter b. This model allows a very accurate estimate of the path losses of the three technologies. A clear correlation was observed between parameter b and standard deviation σ.",

In this paper, we propose a new method called Correlation Function Separation Technique (CFST) combine with the Lervenberg-Marquardt Algorithm (LMA) using the Impulse Radio Ultra-Wide Band (IR-UWB) penetrating system to improve the accuracy in detecting and positioning of the adjacent buried objects in building structures. Based on the UWB signal processing, the proposed method can be used to determine both the relative permittivity of the environment and the position of the buried objects,  especially the adjacent objects. The analytical method is validated by mathematical proofs and Matlab simulations, and the position errors are used to assess the performance of proposed method. The numerical results shown that the proposed method can be used for positioning the adjacent buried objects in the homogeneous environment which has an average positioning error of 3.52cm, which is smaller than that of the conventional method based on B-canned radar images processing.",

        "Abstract": "In this paper, the Half-Duplex Relay Channel (HDRC) is thoroughly investigated. Even though this channel model is widely studied, the capacity is not yet fully understood and particularly has not been tightly expressed. In this work, a new capacity expression of the discrete memoryless HDRC is explicitly established. In particular, a new expression of the achievable rate is derived by taking advantage of the well-known capacity results of both the degraded broadcast channel and the multiple access channel. Specifically, in order to obtain the achievable rate, the transmission from the source to destination is operated over two phases. In the first phase, the broadcast phase, the source broadcasts to both relay and destination. In the second phase, both source and relay transmit to destination to form multiple access channel. Then, we prove that the new achievable rate meets the cut-set outer bound such that the capacity of the discrete memoryless HDRC is attained. Next, the new derived capacity result is extended to the case of additive Gaussian channel. Further, the attained capacity is analytically and then numerically shown to encompass  all well-known available findings in the literature. Additional numerical examples are also shown to present the cases in which the relay is beneficial and how the achievable capacity varies with the source-relay and relay-destination channel gains.",

The performance of the proposed circuit is examined for non ideal effects of CFOA. Effective impedance of scaled FC is examined through MATLAB simulations. The functionality of the realized scalers is verified using SPICE simulations where the FC is modelled using domino RC ladder network. Simulation results for impedance magnitude and phase responses are presented for various scaling factors and are compared with theoretical counterparts. The circuit application of proposed FC scaler is demonstrated through implementation of fractional order lossy and lossless integrators; and may be extended to fractional order filters, oscillators, controllers etc.",

The flow starts with the training of the neural network model from the selected behavioral level parameters, which imposes to provide accurate estimations. The model accuracy is validated against ITC99 benchmark programs. The run-times are faster than the synthesis run-times. For the ASIC-based designs, the proposed model took 5 seconds, while Synopsys Design Compiler took 5 minutes. In terms of timing, the estimation speed is more than the order of magnitude faster than the conventional synthesis-based approach. The modeling methodology provides a better, accurate, and fast area and power estimations, at an early stage of the Very-Large-Scale Integration (VLSI) design. In addition, the model eliminates the need for synthesis-based exploration and provides the design picking before synthesis.",

Mitigation technique against the power dissipation build-up, higher than the operational margins recommended by a manufacturer, on the TE were proposed and modelled using Laplace Transform (LT) analysis. A mathematical model and an optimization algorithm were developed to determine the equivalent circuit model parameters of a Transient Overload Protection Module (TOPM) that would offer adequate protection against destructive power dissipation levels build-up on the TE. The mathematical model was developed using an 8 kV ESD, which was expected to deliver short-circuit current with a peak value of approximately 5.33 A through a load impedance of approximately 1 m\\varOmega. The ESD stress signal was injected into the TOPM connected in parallel with the TE. The active power dissipated by the SJTC TE per period of transient response was calculated from the current and voltage obtained from the mathematical analysis, and the results indicate a power dissipation of 10 mW by the TE. From the algorithm, the model parameter that noticeably influences the power dissipation capabilities of the TOPM is the inductance and it must be smaller than 1.2 nH. A CAD based simulation model was developed and analysed. The simulation results agreed with the mathematical model.",

        "Abstract": "The choice of gate metal technology for junctionless transistors needs to have diverse characteristics as metals have distinct work functions and hence, they show incompatibility while tailoring threshold of the device. In such a scenario, bimetallic stacked gate can be a promising candidate to present wide range of tunable work functions required for nano-regime junctionless transistors. This paper explores the electronic phenomena occurring at metal-metal interface and the impact of Platinum (Pt)/Titanium (Ti) bimetallic stacked gate-based work function tunability on the RF and thermal performances of p-type window-based Silicon on Insulator Junctionless Transistor (SOI JLT) using numerical simulator SILVACO ATLAS. The parameters considered for performance evaluation are ON-state current (I_{ON}), OFF-state current (I_{OFF}), I_{ON}/I_{OFF} ratio, transconductance (g_m),\\linebreak cutoff frequency (f_T), Transconductance Frequency Product (TFP), Intrinsic Gate Delay (IGD), intrinsic gain (A_V), and Global Device Temperature (GDT). The g_m, f_T, TFP, A_V and GDT improve for modified over conventional in the ON state at higher work function, while IGD improves at lower work function. The improvements of 11.7% and 2.21% are obtained in maximum g_m and f_T, respectively, for modified transistor over conventional. The findings suggest that bimetallic stacked gate modified SOIJLT is a better option than conventional for low-power RF application.",

        "Abstract": "This paper investigates a degradation of three types of automotive power MOSFETs through repetitive Unclamped Inductive Switching (UIS) test typically used to evaluate the avalanche robustness of power devices. It is not uncommon in switching applications that greater than the planned voltage for voltage spikes can occur, so even the best electronic designs may encounter frequent avalanche events. Hence, there is a need to analyse the impact of repetitive avalanching on the electrical performance of power transistors. This article focused on the shift of main electrical parameters: on-resistance R_{ON}, breakdown voltage V_{BR}, threshold voltage V_{TH}, and corresponding characteristics, as well as capacitances. Analysis proved that DMOS transistors are less vulnerable to repetitive avalanching. The most impacted parameter was on-resistance R_{DSon}, where a 14 % increase was observed after 6 x 10^7 stress pulses. The parameters shift is attributed to hot carrier injection in the space charge region of blocking PN junction and involves mainly defects generation/activation in the drain side region of the gate oxide. For the TrenchMOS transistor, a significant shift of I-V curves was observed with considerable impact on the R_{ON} where an increase of 22 % was observed. The trench corner is verified to be the mainly degraded region by Synopsys Technology Computer Aided Design (TCAD) simulations. Degradation of drain-gate capacitance C_{DG} and input capacitance C_{in} was observed in all three types of analysed structures. DLTS was used to verify the generation/activation of defects invoked by stress. An increase of DLTS signal corresponding to energy levels of oxygen vacancies and impurities in SiO_2 and on interfaces were detected on stressed samples.",

        "Abstract": "In this paper, Bidimensional Empirical Mode Decomposition (BEMD) based Cross Bilateral Filter (CBF) technique for speckle reduction in ultrasound images has been proposed. The reference image is obtained by denoising the noisy image using pixel-wise Wiener filtering. Then, both the noisy image and the reference image are decomposed into a set of Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs) and the residue image using BEMD technique. CBF is applied between noisy image IMFs and the corresponding reference image IMFs. The image is reconstructed back with these modified IMFs and the residue. The proposed method exploits the edge information in the reference image for improving the quality of the denoised image. The performance of the proposed method has been tested for real ultrasound images and simulated images having noise of different variance. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm performs better than other state-of-art methods in terms of Edge Keeping Index (EKI), Correlation Coefficient (CC), Figure of Merit (FOM), Structural Similarity (SSIM), Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) for synthetic images. The algorithm gives better performance for real ultrasound images in terms of Mean to Variance Ratio (MVR) and Equivalent Number of Looks (ENL).",

Film thicknesses were in the range of 20-25 nm. Rutherford backscattering spectrometry and Elastic recoil detection analytical method determined  the concentration of elements in the films. Scanning electron microscopy scanned the surface morphology of carbon films. Raman spectroscopy was used for chemical structural properties determination of very thin carbon films. Raman spectra intensities were fitted with Gaussian peaks. The photo-induced (pulsed laser - 266 nm) electron emission properties of very thin nanostructured carbon films were investigated by the measurement of cathode bunch charge at different electric field and calculate quantum efficiency. The influence of different electric field on the photo-induced electron emission characteristics of prepared transmission photocathodes are discussed.",

        "Abstract": "Research on data-driven bearing fault diagnosis techniques has recently drawn more and more attention due to the availability of massive condition monitoring data. The research work presented in this paper aims to develop an architecture for the detection and diagnosis of bearing faults in the induction machines. The developed data-oriented architecture uses vibration signals collected by sensors placed on the machine, which is based, in the first place, on the extraction of fault indicators based on the harmonics-to-noise ratio envelope. Normalisation is then applied to the extracted indicators to create a well-processed data set. The evolution of these indicators will be studied afterwards according to the type and severity of defects using sequential backward selection technique. Supervised machine learning classification methods are developed to classify the measurements described by the feature vector with respect to the known modes of operation. In the last phase concerning decision making, ten classifiers are tested and applied based on the selected and combined indicators. The developed classification methods allow classifying the observations, with respect to the different modes of bearing condition (outer race, inner race fault or healthy condition). The proposed method is validated on data collected using an experimental bearing test bench. The experimental results indicate that the proposed architecture achieves high accuracy in bearing fault detection under all operational conditions. The results show that, compared to some proposed approaches, our proposed architecture can achieve better performance overall in terms of the number of optimal features and the accuracy of the tests.",

        "Abstract": "This paper deals with a system that consists of a combination of wind and solar sources. The wind energy unit is the primary energy source that feeds the load and is controlled by the I cos Phi algorithm. The algorithm’s efficiency is tested under normal operation and when one of the phases in the load is disconnected. This algorithm efficiently maintains the voltage and frequency during these conditions. The solar unit is directly connected with the battery energy storage system and is used to charge the battery. It implements MPPT using Perturb and Observe (P&O) method. The hybrid system is simulated in MATLAB/SIMULINK. It is found to perform and maintain the frequency and the potential at the load side and the point of common coupling under normal operation and varying load conditions. I cos Phi algorithm, which controls the switching signals, requires simple calculations for generating reference source currents. This algorithm does not need conversion from one frame to another, making the system respond for quick dynamics and improved power quality. The perturb and observe method is proven to ensure the maximum power extraction from the solar panel. Thus, the combination of these two techniques makes the system act efficiently and handle load disturbances.",

This paper presents a benchmark of the parametric models for non-intrusive estimation of the audio quality perceived by the end user. The proposed solution is based on machine learning techniques for broadcasting systems and web-casting applications. The main goal of this study is to assess the performance of the non-intrusive parametric models as well as to evaluate a statistical significance of the performance differences between those models. The paper provides a comparison of several models based on the Support Vector Regression, Genetic Programming, Multigene Symbolic Regression, Neural Networks and Random Forest. The obtained results indicate that among the investigated models the most accurate, although not the fastest ones, are the model based on Random Forest (a broadcast scenario) and the SVR-based model (a web-cast scenario). These models represent promising candidates for non-intrusive parametric audio quality assessment in the context of broadcasting systems and web-casting applications.",

Most prior works consider perfect hardware impairment and apply the Orthogonal Multiple Access (OMA) technique, but this paper investigates the case of Outage Probability (OP) reduction situation when the hardware is imperfect, especially when the Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) technology is applied. Consequently, we design a downlink of transmission from base station to destination to highlight different performances among users. Furthermore, to indicate the impact of levels of hardware impairment, we develop the closed-form expressions of OP for different kinds of users. Finally, extensive simulation results validate the analysis and illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed system.",

        "Abstract": "In any wide-range processing system, rapid interconnecting networks are employed between the processing modules and embedded systems. This study deals with the optimized design and implementation of Switching Element (SE) which operates in four modes, accepting two inputs and delivering two outputs. The Shuffle-Exchange Network (SEN) can be used as a single-stage as well as a multi-stage network. SEN is used as an interconnection architecture which is implemented with exclusive input-output paths with simple design. The SE acts as a building block to the Multi-stage Shuffle-Exchange Network (M-SEN) with facilities to perform unicast and multicast operation on the inputs. An 8x8 M-SEN model is also implemented, which works in three modes of communication, termed as \"One-to-One\", \"One-to-Many\" and \"One-to-All\" M-SEN configuration. All the QCA circuits have been implemented and simulated using CAD tool QCADesigner. The proposed QCA-based M-SEN design is better in terms of area occupied by 14.63%, average energy dissipation by 22.75% and cell count with a reduction of 84 cells when compared to reference M-SEN architecture. The optimization of the design in terms of cell count and area results in lesser energy dissipation and hence can be used in future-generation complex networks and communication systems.",

Impact of parameters like Single-Mode Fiber (SMF) length, Radiofrequency (RF) amplitude, and laser linewidth on Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) has been investigated. It has been observed that eliminating one of the second-order sidebands with 120° hybrid coupler improves peak SNR in comparison to 90° hybrid coupler with both second-order sidebands and DP-DDMZM-based system without second-order sidebands irrespective of Continuous Wave (CW) laser linewidth.",

The obtained results show that the increases of gate bias effect on substrate lead to decreasing the source resistance of the simulated device. The reported increase in the effect of gate induces the increases of transferred holes concentration towards the source region and which induce the decreases of source resistance. The decrease of source resistance can also be made by reducing the buffer thickness which leads to an increase in the gate effect on the substrate. The source resistance value is influenced by the Drain-Induced Barrier Lowering (DIBL) effect where the rate of decreasing the source resistance will be decreasing consequently to increase the drain bias. The reduction of the source resistance induces the increase of device sensibility for lows values of current.",

Their structure consists of a core containing hundreds or even thousands of thin layers, covered on both sides with thick cladding waveguides. Such a laser design creates enormous stresses in the core and can cause degradation of the entire device. An alternative to the thick InP claddings are thin, highly doped InGaAs layers used as plasmonic waveguides. This solution allows to achieve a mode confinement above 50% even at only 150 nm of the waveguide layer, which is extremely difficult in the case of standard designs.

Usually, in metallic ohmic annealed contacts of AlGaN/GaN heterostructures, titanium is applied as the first layer, but scandium may be an alternative. It was proved to be useful to obtain both ohmic and Schottky characteristics, depending on annealing temperature of the contact. In the presented research, contacts including scandium (Sc/Al/Mo/Au) were fabricated, and, as reference sample, contacts with titanium including metallziation (Ti/Al/Mo/Au). Reference sample was annealed at 825°C, and forming temperatures for scandium contacts were 825°C, 625°C, and 425°C. All samples after thermal formation process were additionally thickened with Ru/Au bilayer. To quickly compare level of metals in metallization mixing during formation process and to check applicability of EDS (Energy-Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy), the simulations of electrons trajectories and EDS point scans were performed.",

        "Abstract": "On-die testing can accelerate development of semiconductor devices, but poses certain challenges related to high frequency and high current switching. This paper describes design and development of a tester for double-pulse switching test and measurement of dynamic on-state resistance of unpackaged High-Electron-Mobility Transistors (GaN HEMTs). The tester is capable of switching an inductive load at drain-to-source voltage up to 400 V and drain current up to 10 A. Design challenges resulting from specific properties of GaN HEMTs and on-die measurement are explained, and solutions are proposed. Essential parts of the developed device are described, including low inductance gate-driver and measurement methods. Modified drain voltage clamping circuit for accurate on-state drain voltage measurement is described. The tester is constructed as a printed circuit board, integrated into a probe station. Voltage and current waveforms are measured with oscilloscope and used to calculate the on-resistance. Results of a reference measurement with commercially available packaged transistors are presented. Waveforms measured on experimental unpackaged normally-off GaN HEMT samples are also presented and discussed. The proposed tester device proved to be capable of performing the dynamic on-resistance measurement with satisfactory results.",

Electron beam trajectory simulations, carried out for real experimental boundaries, enabled us to reveal and explain the unique optical properties which were employed in the instrumental optimisation followed by empirical, spectromicroscopic applications. In terms of numerical treatment, it was possible to verify the low-aberration imaging in reciprocal and real spaces at π and 2π, respectively, and the advantage of energy-selective visualisation of the k-space. Furthermore, this unique feature has been proven and confirmed experimentally by implementing the HeI/HeII monochromatic photon source into our improved spectromicroscopic system and by the energy-selective visualisation of an electronic state projection in the reciprocal plane. A clear correlation between a numerically simulated electronic projection and an experimentally-obtained k-space imaging has been demonstrated.",

The IEC definition indices of Voltage Unbalance Factor (VUF) and Complex Voltage Unbalance Factor (CVUF) which consist of magnitude and phase angle of the unbalance supply are used for the analysis. Also, this paper evaluates the impact of voltage unbalance and firing angle of the inverter on the stator and rotor motor parameters, motor currents, copper losses, efficiency, power factor, torque-speed characteristics, prediction of peak currents of the stator and rotor phase windings, and Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) of stator and rotor currents. The proposed mathematical model of SPRIMDS is validated using MATLAB-Simulink. The results have shown that the performance of the SPRIMDS and variation of motor currents, efficiency, THD and torque are depending on the magnitude of the voltage unbalance and inverter's firing angle.",

The design of the introduced driver enables to adjust the output voltage levels easily by choosing the integrated linear voltage stabilizers with suitable output parameters used for Printed Circuit Board (PCB) mounting. The voltage insulation of the proposed driver between the primary control side and the secondary output side is performed by MGJ6D12H24MC muRata Ps DC-DC converter with a declared dv/dt immunity 80 kV/1000 ms at 1.6 kV and by IX3180 IXYS High Speed gate driver optocouplers with a declared 10 kV/1000 ms minimum common mode rejection at 1.5 kV. The voltage insulation of these coupling elements is accompanied by safety gaps on the PCB. These insulation features enable the proposed driver to work on high frequencies as a high-side transistor of H-bridges as same as in other power converter topologies with a high frequency and high voltage stress of the insulation border. The proposed driver also provides the possibility of tripping the signal, when the short circuit of the controlled power transistor occurs.",

        "Abstract": "In a wireless system, dual-hop transmission requires Full-Duplex (FD) to transmit signals from the base station too far users. It is more beneficial if we deploy non-orthogonal multiple access to serve specific users, i.e. normal users (near and far users) and device-to-device users. The fairness and outage performance of these users can be studied. We particularly focus on mathematical analysis of outage performance which is computed based on Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) of received signals at each kind of user. We derive a closed-form formula of such outage probability along with throughput. To realize both the FD NOMA, this paper performs system performance metrics and considers how self-interference make influences system performance. The simulation results validate the theoretical analysis and show that our scheme can obtain a better outage probability and throughput performance with high transmit SNR at the base station and lower required target rates.",

The linear frequency modulation is used to resolve range resolution problems. This paper provides a new algorithm for detecting linear frequency modulation signals at a low signal-to-noise ratio. The core idea of the proposed method is firstly to analyse the linear frequency modulation signals via Fast Fourier Transform; and then to accumulate all energy to achieve signal detection using cross-correlation methods. The proposed algorithm showed better results in comparison with current algorithms, which are used to estimate the parameters of the linear frequency modulation signals at a low signal-to-noise ratio.",

The purpose of the study was to improve slip ratio tracking and eliminate cycling while achieving very much shortened distance during emergency braking.  The model of a braking vehicle at speed of 30 m.s^-1 subject to wheel locking was developed and implemented in MATLAB/Simulink environment. Simulation was conducted without a controller to study the slip ratio performance of the system on different road surfaces. The simulation results showed that stopping distance was 135.2 m in 5 seconds. A Fuzzy Logic Controller (FLC) whose control signal was enhanced by adding an adjustable gain mechanism to its output was designed.  Simulation results showed that the AGE-FLC controller offered optimal tracking of desired wheel slip ratio of 0.1 as fast as possible on all road surface scenarios, while improving the stopping distance by 70.4% on dry road surface, 63.3% on wet road surface, 57.5% on cobblestone road surface and 48.8% on snow road surface in 2.651seconds.",

        "Abstract": "The ever-increasing demand for high-quality digital video requires efficient compression techniques and fast video codecs. It necessitates increased complexity of the video codec algorithms. So, there is a need for hardware accelerators to implement such complex algorithms. The latest video compression algorithms such as High-Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) and Versatile Video Coding (VVC) have been adopted Context-based Adaptive Binary Arithmetic Coding (CABAC) as the entropy coding method. The CABAC has two main data processing paths: regular and bypass bin path, which can achieve good compression when used with Syntax Elements (SEs) statistics. However, it is highly intrinsic data dependence and has sequential coding characteristics. Thus, it is challenging to parallelize. In this work, a 6-core bypass bin path having high-throughput and low hardware area has been proposed. It is a parallel architecture capable of processing up to 6 bypass bins per clock cycle to improve throughput. Further, the resource-sharing techniques within the binarization and a common controller block have reduced the hardware area. The proposed architecture has been simulated, synthesized, and prototyped on 28 nm Artix 7 Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). The implementation of Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) has been done using 65 nm CMOS technology. The proposed design achieved a throughput of 1.26 Gbin/s at 210 MHz operating frequency with a low hardware area compared to existing architectures. This architecture also supports multi-standard (HEVC/VVC) encoders for Ultra High Definition (UHD) applications.",

This re-arranging circuit can work as a sinusoidal oscillator as well as a current-mode universal filter, by simple selection of passive switches. Both the circuits employ only two active devices and three grounded passive elements. The designed oscillator provides two distinctive current outputs with a quadrature-phase difference. It also maintains an independent condition of oscillation and frequency of oscillation. Moreover, the basic responses including low pass, high pass, and band pass are easily available from a current-mode universal filter. The low input impedance and high output impedance are amongst the noteworthy features of the current-mode derived filter. Non-ideal, parasitic, and sensitivity analysis of the designed circuits are also incorporated in the manuscript. Cadence PSPICE software simulation results are also included to justify the design idea. Experimental implementation of the described circuit has also been shown by employing special-purpose amplifier integrated circuit, i.e., OPA860.",

        "Abstract": "There is a recent boom being witnessed in emerging areas like IoMT (Internet of Medical Things), Artificial Intelligence for healthcare, and disaster management. These novel research frontiers are critical in terms of hardware and cannot afford to compromise accuracy or reliability. Multiplier, being one of the most heavily used components, becomes crucial in these applications. If optimized, multipliers can impact the overall performance of the system. Thus, in this paper, an attempt has been made to determine the potential of accurate multipliers while meeting minimal hardware requirements. In this paper, we propose a novel Booth-Encoded Karatsuba multiplier and provide its comparison with a Booth-Encoded Wallace tree multiplier. These architectures have been developed using two types of Booth encoding: Radix-4 and Radix-8 for 16-bit, 32-bit and 64-bit multiplications. The algorithm is designed to be parameterizable to different bit widths, thereby offering higher flexibility. The proposed mul- tiplier offers advantage of enhanced performance with significant reduction in hardware while negligibly trad- ing off the Power Delay Product (PDP). It has been observed that the performance of the proposed architecture increases with increasing multiplier size due to significant reduction in hardware and slight increase in PDP. All the architectures have been implemented in Verilog HDL using Xilinx Vivado Design Suite.",

A new modified Incremental Conductance (INC) algorithm is proposed to extract maximum power from PV panels at different levels of temperature and solar irradiation. The considered PV system consists of a PV panel, a DC-DC boost converter controlled by MPPT algorithm and a resistive load. First, the simulation tests of the proposed algorithm using Matlab/Simulink environment are presented, and then, followed by a real-time implementation using Arduino Mega board and a specific package known as ``Simulink support package for arduino hardware'' to validate experimentally the~simulation tests. Simulation and experimental results show that the proposed modified INC algorithm offers much less oscillation around the Maximum Power Point (MPP), fast dynamic response and better performances compared to the conventional INC algorithm.",

The proposed Mamdani type fuzzy inference system with subsequent application of the Bellman-Zadeh decision-making method is used to evaluate the reliability of the power line feeders as criteria for power system planning. Unplanned outages of system components, the Energy Not Supplied (ENS) and age of the power lines are used as input variables of the system and are fuzzified using triangular fuzzy functions. The proposed model was tested on a model of a realistic distribution network in order to prove its relevance and applicability. Results demonstrated that this model could make a contribution in this field as it can be used in practical planning situations for project priority ranking.",

The energy performance of road lighting is conveniently described by the pair of normative numerical indicators PDI and AECI established in European standards. This article aims to present typical values of these indicators for different combinations of road arrangements, road widths, lighting classes and light source technologies to illustrate what benchmarks can be expected using this assessment system. Objectives of the article also comprise discussion on factors influencing the energy performance and conclusion whether it is appropriate to introduce limiting value requirements and/or ranking systems to label energy performance of road lighting systems.",

        "Abstract": "A binary comparator architecture is proposed in this work for static logic to achieve both low-power and high-performance operations. It also presents a detailed timing performance and power analysis of various state-of-the-art comparator designs. The main advantages of this design are its high speed and power efficiency maintained over a wide range of operands size, which is useful at low-input data activity environments. The proposed circuit design uses minimum fan-in and fan-out logic gates for achieving high speed and low power dissipation. Utilizing a 2-bit binary comparator circuit with minimum fan-in and fan-out of logic gates (NAND-NOR), the architecture of a parallel binary comparator is proposed for higher input operands by using a low radix multiplexer and priority encoder. Further, to decrease the size of the multiplexer and priority encoder by two times, a general architecture is also proposed by using a 4-bit binary comparator to reduce its complexity. The proposed circuits are optimized in terms of the power consumption and delay, which are due to low load capacitance, low leakages, and reduced dynamic power dissipation. Each of the proposed circuits has its own merits in terms of speed, power consumption, Power-Delay Product (PDP). Its synthesis is done on 180 nm as well as 90 nm CMOS technology using the Cadence tool. The physical layout of the proposed architecture using a 90 nm CMOS process (GPDK process) is also obtained.",

The noisy image has been decomposed into its Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs) and a~residue. The noise component of the low order IMFs is removed with the pixel-wise Wiener filtering. The image is reconstructed with these filtered low order IMFs, high order IMFs and the residue. The performance of the proposed method has been tested on synthetic as well as real ultrasound images having noise components of different variance. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm performs better than other existing methods for synthetic images as well as real ultrasound images in terms of various image quality matrices.",

        "Abstract": "Intrinsic resistivity of any semiconductor silicon layer strongly depends on dopants and impurities concentrations. Structural properties, treating, coating, finishing etc. affect dynamic resistance behaviour of a given p-n junction in a wafer. It is important for massively used photovoltaics, optoelectronics, microelectronics, and other solid-state electronics. In this work, efficient, universally applicable methodology is presented to investigate silicon resistive parameters. First, the silicon band gap models are studied. Influence of electrical resistivity on resistances and complex impedance parts is investigated. Dynamic iterative numerical modelling and simulations combined with sparse-matrix experimental measurements lead to extrapolated behaviours of these resistive parameters. All parameters are investigated within acceptable practical interval up to extremals.",

        "Abstract": "One of the most significant processes in micro- and nanoelectronics technology is Electron Beam Lithography (EBL). This technique maintains a leading role in extremely high-resolution structures fabrication process with micro- and nanometer dimensions down to dozens of nanometers. The EBL is a highly complex process and determining fundamental technological factors that affect the final pattern shape is crucial. One of them is the used lithography system, consisting of a substrate and a polymer layer that affects the electron scattering effects. To obtain the required pattern geometry, it is also necessary to properly select the electron beam parameters for given materials. The aim of this work is to discuss the differences in the exposition process for various accelerating voltage (EHT) values. Additionally, the investigation of geometry features and the impact of the exposure dose and the structure dimensions on the final absorbed energy distribution profile in the resist layer is presented and discussed. Numerical studies, using CASINO software and Monte Carlo method, are presented to compare the energy distribution in the polymer that affects the structure formation in the resist layer.",

Both methods are very attractive because of their simple digital implementation, low computational load and good performance under harmonically distorted grid conditions and variable frequency, so they are a good alternative to other known methods. The paper derives and analyzes the full state space models of the two methods.It is shown that these two methods are equivalent in the most common operation conditions of distributed energy resources, although the APF structure is clearly better than the SOGI one because it maintains its orthogonal generation ability for any higher notch frequencies and any lower sampling frequencies. The comparative analysis were validated by simulation with MATLAB/Simulink and experimental results using a fixed-point DSP.",

        "Abstract": "This paper focuses on the investigation of the dynamic characteristics of Ultra High Voltage Direct Current (UHVDC) system Under Hierarchical Infeed Mode (UHVDC-HIM) with Static Synchronous Compensator (STATCOM). The STATCOM at the inverter side of UHVDC-HIM is developed in PSCAD/EMTDC, and their power flow equations are derived. Based on these equations, the control schemes for rectifier and inverter side of UHVDC-HIM and STATCOM are properly designed. Several dynamic characteristics indices such as Commutation Failure Immunity Index (CFII), Commutation Failure Probability Index (CFPI), fault recovery time and Temporary Overvoltage (TOV) are evaluated in detail. The impact of different sizes of STATCOM and Short Circuit Ratio (SCR) of AC sources on dynamic characteristics of UHVDC-HIM system during single-phase and three-phase faults are examined. The analysis shows that higher SCR values and greater capacity of STATCOM can make the UHVDC-HIM system less vulnerable to Commutation Failure (CF), considerably enhance the fault recovery time and effectively reduce the TOV.",

        "Abstract": "A promising technology for addressing network lifetime and energy bottlenecks in wireless networks is the Simultaneous Wireless Information and Power Transfer (SWIPT). In this paper, a Hybrid Time switching and Power splitting-based Relaying (HTPR) protocol for SWIPT in an Amplify-and-Forward (AF) network is proposed. The network consists of a source, relay, and destination in which the relay performs Energy Harvesting (EH) from the source signal and uses the harvested energy to transmit the signal to the destination. A direct link exists between the source and destination, and the signals from the source and relay are combined by the Maximum Ratio Combining (MRC) method at the destination. Closed-form expressions for outage probability are derived under delay-limited transmission to determine the achievable throughput at the destination in different transmission schemes. For a constant data rate, HTPR protocol with uniform and optimal EH ratios are considered for throughput maximization. To solve the optimization problem, the convex optimization technique Lagrange multiplier method and Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions are used. Results show that the HTPR protocol has higher throughput than other SWIPT protocols at relatively high Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR).",

        "Abstract": "This work proposes new control approaches for tracking and motion planning of Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs) that utilize skid steering system. This work proposes an energy based Variable Structure Control (VSC) scheme, in which two independent Sliding Control Surfaces (SCS)s are designed based on the system states. Particularly, the controller is designed based on the assessment and the minimization of the systems total energy by finding an explicit relation between the controller gains and the slope of the sliding surface. The work also discusses a new fuzzy potential approach for motion planning of UGV. The Fuzzy system generates an attractive force that pulls the UGV effectively toward a moving or stationary target, and a repulsive force, which is required to avoid any stationary or moving obstacles. Both, the VSC and the motion planning were validated by a nonlinear model of an Unmanned Tracked Robot (UTR) on different trajectories, and was compared with different control schemes. Simulation results show superiority of the proposed VSC over other methods with less control effort. Furthermore, the new motion planning controller proved its high capacity in producing a smooth and dynamic trajectory to allow an UGV to track a target and to avoid obstacles.",

This paper proposes a low-power MOS Current Mode Logic (MCML) design, termed as Hybrid Dynamic Current Mode Logic with modified current source (H-MDyCML). In H-MDyCML circuits, the functions are realized using complementary pass transistor logic which helps to overcome the problem of stacking of transistors in multiple levels. The dynamic current source has also been modified from an NMOS transistor to a PMOS transistor-driven current source which leads to the elimination of the use of CMOS inverter. H-MDyCML circuits are compared with other existing designing styles: Dynamic CML (DyCML), Hybrid DyCML (H-DyCML), and DyCML with modified current source (Dy-CML-NP). The proposed design (H-MDyCML) shows an overall improvement (in terms of Power Delay Product (PDP)) up to 94.77% compared to DyCML, 52.17% compared to Dy-CML-NP, and 91.40% compared to H-DyCML, for single stage circuits.",

        "Abstract": "Mobile health (mHealth) apps are increasingly adopted in healthcare domains, such as diabetes management, physical activity monitoring, and HIV treatment. However, mHealth app development is restricted due to healthcare privacy regulations, which require apps to handle collected data securely. The advent of online platforms, such as REDCap, alleviates this problem by providing privacy-compliant databases, so that mHealth apps developed for research groups can securely handle stored inactive data (data-at-rest) with fewer privacy concerns.\r\nUnfortunately, the authentication architectures of many online platforms do not meet the needs of mHealth apps and provide insufficient integration support. Assumptions made in other types of mobile apps about how users operate, such as a user's ability to type or remember a password, therefore may not be valid in the mHealth domain. \r\nTo address these problems this paper evaluates how authentication approaches impact the usability of mHealth apps. In particular, we present metrics to evaluate usability and show how the Proxy User Adapter pattern can integrate usability-enhanced authentication approaches to legacy secure database providers. We also propose a QR-Code authentication approach that applies the Proxy User Adapter pattern to help mHealth apps overcome common impediments, improve processing efficiency, and reduce potential mistakes caused by patients and providers alike.",

        "Abstract": "For the purpose of improving the service quality, video surveillance systems are widely used to standardize the service process in power supply business halls. If the employers check surveillance video to ensure predefined process of staff behaviours, it will be characterized as time-consuming. In recent years, great progress has been made in intelligent action recognition using Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs). However, due to the small range of staffs' motion and similar scene information of power supply business halls, the performance of using traditional CNNs to recognize service actions, e.g. bowing, standing and sitting, is general. For improving the recognition rate, this paper proposes a 3D-fused Convolutional Network (ConvNet) for service actions recognition, which focuses on detecting the actions in the typical scene of one staff person and one customer with a well-segmented video clip. The well-segmented video clips are sent as input to the 3D-fused ConvNet for action recognition. The 3D-fused ConvNet consists of two base learners, optical flow base learner and RGB base learner. Both learners use the Convolutional 3D (C3D) architecture. Specifically, the RGB learner can be used to capture the features of small staffs' motion while the optical flow base learner can be viewed as the key part to eliminate the influence of the background, especially in a similar scene. Furthermore, prediction scores of two base learners can be weighted by the softmax function according to the performance of each base learner. Finally, the prediction scores of the two base learners are fused to obtain the prediction result, namely the specific actions of the staffs in the videos. The experiment result shows that the proposed method achieves 92.41% accuracy on the service action dataset of the power supply business hall.",

Hall Effect sensors have been used to obtain position data of the motor. Since Hall Effect sensors have been mounted, PMSM has been driven as a Brushless DC BLDC) motor. Sinusoidal and trapezoidal current reference models have been used in the control system. The proposed control system has been operated for speed control as well as position control of the motor. The developed genetic-based speed and position control method has been tested for both trapezoidal and sinusoidal PWM commutation techniques. The results obtained from these commutation techniques have been compared. Speed and position results of the motor have been obtained under the different load and operating conditions. The results reveal that the proposed control system is reliable, robust and effective.",

The Distributed Generation (DG) resources play an important role in the supply of active and reactive power loads, bus voltage profiles, and voltage stability in distribution systems. In this paper, a new technique has been proposed for optimization of the location placement and sizing of DGs, considering the Generalized voltage Stability Index (GSI) to determine the maximum load-ability. Also, an analytical method has been applied to infer the effects of DGs on the distribution systems’ characteristics. The study also considers three types of DG modes, which are voltage control mode (PV mode), constant power mode (PQ mode), and also voltage control mode with reactive power constraint (PV mode with VAR constraint). The proposed method is applied to 12-bus, modified 12-bus, 69-bus and 94-bus radial distribution systems.",

The inter-cell interference and the intra-cell interference are also taken into consideration to capture practical behaviors of the proposed system. Further, we also adopt the Poisson Point Process (PPP) to model the location of the base stations and the downlink users in this work. For the imperfect CSI scenario, the results point out that the more times the user spends on performing interference cancellation, the more severe the user is affected by channel estimation error and vice versa. The results for the outage probability expressed in the analytical-forms are then confirmed by the Monte Carlo simulations.",

        "Abstract": "Objective quality assessment models have been used more and more in recent years to assess or monitor speech and audio quality in many multimedia and audio processing systems. These methods offer a clear and repeatable way to evaluate a customer experience by measuring perceived quality on a subjective scale, which is easily understood, such as a quality rating scale, ranging from excellent quality to a low quality. Subsequently, the aim of service providers is to offer reliable services providing the end-user/customer with the best possible quality in the context of the current network conditions to avoid a customer churn. This paper presents a design and performance evaluation of parametric models estimating the audio quality experienced by the end user of broadcasting systems and web-casting applications. The Random Forest (RF) algorithm is used to design non-intrusive parametric models, establishing the relationship between the feature description and the perceived quality scores. For this, the broadcast and web-cast sub-databases were created, where the web-cast sub-database includes 17.280 degraded samples and the broadcast sub-database contains 1080 degraded samples obtained from the Slovak Radio. The results reported for the proposed parametric audio quality models have validated Random Forest as a powerful technique that provides a good efficiency in terms of Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).",

        "Abstract": "The design of transconductance-mode multifunction biquad filter containing three input voltage nodes and single-output current node is proposed. Its circuit principle is emphasized on employing Voltage Differencing Current Conveyor (VDCC) to be an active building block. The proposed filter description uses three VDCCs co-working with two grounded capacitors and three grounded resistors. The synthesis of the proposed multifunction filter is based on avoidance of using multiple-output active elements to achieve commercially available integrated circuits for practical implementation. Additionally, without multiple-output active element, it can alleviate current tracking error from the current mirrors used in output ports. It also decreases the amounts of the transistors inside the active elements. The proposed multifunction filter offers all 5 filter functions, which are non-inverting Low-Pass (LP), non-inverting High-Pass (HP), non-inverting Band-Pass (BP), non-inverting Band-Reject (BR) and also non-inverting All-Pass (AP) functions from same circuit topology under different circuit condition for input signals. Furthermore, the natural frequency for all filtering responses is independently achieved from the bandwidth or the quality factor of the proposed filter. For cascade-able connectivity, the output current port indeed provides a high impedance. In addition, the magnitude of the output current for all filtering functions can be resistively adjusted. The consideration for non-ideal case of the presented multifunction filter is also analyzed. The simulation and experimental results of the presented transconductance  multifunction biquad filter based on VDCC practically implemented by the commercially available ICs, LM13700 and AD844 can validate the theoretical anticipation.",

        "Abstract": "In this paper, two circuits, namely Footer Voltage Controlled Dual Keeper domino logic (FVCDK) and Footer Voltage Controlled Dual Keeper with Static Switching domino logic (FVCDK-SS) are presented, in order to achieve high speed, low power consumption and robustness. The dual keeper arrangement helps in reducing the loop gain of the feedback circuitry, which leads to lower delay variability. The keeper circuitry is controlled using the footer voltage to reduce the contention current in the initial evaluation phase, and thus providing enhanced speed. In FVCDK-SS domino logic, unwanted transients at the output are reduced by incorporating pseudo-dynamic buffer in the proposed FVCDK domino logic. This further reduces the dynamic power consumption. The results of the logic presented here are validated by comparing them to a wide range of existing domino logic circuits for a~variety of performance metrics such as delay, power, power-delay product and unity noise gain. To effectively gauge the wide fan-in capabilities of the proposed logic, results are shown for the various fan-in OR gate. The simulations of the circuits are carried out using industry standard full-suite Cadence tools using 45~nm technology library.",

We introduce several modifications of these descriptors such as global, structural as well as of dominant color. We consider a different number of bins and evaluated the similarity of the color content of images using mean square error of color histograms of a reference image and a searched image. Then, the color content of the image with the minimum error was the most similar to the reference image. We also used a parameter of variance, if the color content of several searched images was very similar based on the mean quadratic error for the structural descriptor.",

Each inverter category is analyzed separately for evaluating the effect of variation in duty ratio on the modulation index and boost factor. The comparisons of these inverters are rendered to quantify the voltage boost ability, voltage stress on the switching device and the voltage gain ability. Moreover, a simple boost control scheme is also modified to attain high modulation index. The efficacy of the proposed results is verified using the Saber software simulations.",

        "Abstract": "The DC-DC converter is majorly used in several renewable energy applications. It is usually relevant in a hard-switching operating mode at the cost of increasing power losses and declining efficiency. Power losses are comprised of switching losses and conduction losses, which affect the reliability and speed up the aging of the switch. Therefore, soft-switching techniques are inescapable to reduce electromagnetic interference EMI, minimize losses, and enhance power conversion efficiency. Among the sundry techniques of soft-switching, passive snubbers are uncomplicated and vigorous, besides it has been spotlighted as a finer alternative compared to the active snubbers that involve extra switches and an additional control circuit. This paper investigates the power loss of a conventional solar DC-DC static converter designed and controlled through Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT). It evaluates the switch's temperature in the hard-switching operating mode. Besides, this paper presents a new research initiative that aims to allow a zero switching and stabilizing the temperature of the switch through a novel approach of design for RLD and RCD snubber cells. This new design allows the switch to achieve soft-switching, by abolishing the voltage stress, minimizing the power losses, and stabilizing the junction temperature. This snubber has a simple structure with a few components and ease of control, which helps to upgrade the power conversion efficiency through controlling the high voltage and current stress in the switch. In this treatise, elements of the snubber are designed and adjusted for maximum reliability through the simulation in OrCAD environment. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the model is approved through experimental results on a 1600 W conventional boost to validate the proposal.",

        "Abstract": "Historically, the negative effects of misalignment between the motor shaft and the load on the electric drives are well known. Vibrations, loss of life of couplings and deterioration of efficiency are some of these effects. Regarding this last point, the literature offers contradictory opinions. Some studies consider that the loss of efficiency in cases of misalignment is undesirable; while others consider that it has significant importance. In this paper, experimental results show in which cases the misalignment has a significant effect on efficiency and in which cases it can be neglected. For this, radial and angular misalignment cases are studied with four of the most used flexible couplings in the industry. The obtained results are analysed in relation to the actual regulations on energy efficiency in induction motors. The reached conclusions offer new tools for the correct selection of flexible couplings tending to the improvement of energy efficiency.",

The observer is built in the synchronous reference frame d-q with three main steps. First, the nonlinear observer for the class of non-affine control systems is reviewed. Second, the induction motor model is written in an appropriate form as a non-affine control system with canonical form for the design of the nonlinear observer. The system state is composed of the stator currents, speed and load torque. Based on the stator currents, the rotor flux leakages are  estimated via an open loop and used for the load torque observer. The observer is designed with a constant gain which is calculated by considering the trajectory of the rotor flux leakages. Both the load torque and rotor speed can be estimated by using the proposed observer.\r\nFinally, simulation and experiment are carried to validate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed observer.",

The estimation of losses without using a mathematical method, but instead using a simulation approach can significantly lower design time. In this paper, the estimation of the power losses by the simulation method using MATLAB Simulink is presented. The main goal of this paper is the estimation of the worst-case scenario of the inverter losses powering the three-phase asynchronous motor. Simulation is using real parameters of the used semiconductors to accurately estimate power losses. The simulation model consists of two main parts. The first one calculates power losses in semiconductors based on the provided parameters and his temperature. The second part calculates the temperature of the system based on the cooling model and losses calculated by the first system. Results in the form of the losses are used in the Fusion 360 software to simulate the temperature distribution of the heatsink. This simulation is supported by the calculation of the convection coefficient of the heatsink in different airflows. Additionally, two types of heat transfer were simulated, convection only and convection plus radiation type of heat dissipation.",

PLL accuracy and fast response are important for control and protection purposes, especially in the presence of voltage harmonics and frequency variations. In this paper, a new PLL structure based on an Adaptive Notch Filter (ANF) is presented. This ANF, which generates the orthogonal system of the PLL, is implemented with an All-Pass Filter (APF) having inherent advantages, such as low sensitivity to coefficient rounding when implemented in fixed-point microprocessors and easy implementation in a Digital Signal Processing (DSP). Both simulation with MATLAB/Simulink, and experimental results on a fixed-point DSP, are presented and analyzed to evaluate the performance of the introduced PLL and to support the theoretical development. A set of comparative simulations between the proposed PLL and a some single-phase PLL described in the literature are conducted to validate the method.",

        "Abstract": "The differential relaying scheme is universally adopted as the main protection for power transformer. In certain situations, like temporary over-fluxing, this differential protection may malfunction. This is due to unbalance in primary and secondary current, as the saturated core does not reflect equal ampere-turn on either side. This article presents detection of over-fluxing condition against the internal fault based on the fifth harmonic component of differential current. As per the estimated level of the fifth harmonic concerning the fundamental component of differential current, the pickup setting of percentage bias characteristic will be modified to avoid maloperation. Once the over-flux condition is sensed, the algorithm activates timer-based V/f protection to protect the equipment. The proposed algorithm is validated on PSCAD software and after the collection of data, MATLAB software is used for further validation. The proposed algorithm is validated under various test conditions like normal load, external fault, internal fault, and over-fluxing. It is observed that the algorithm accurately detects internal fault in the transformer or blocks the relay operation under momentary over-fluxing situations. Further, to assassinate the competency of the proposed scheme, a practical test is performed on a single-phase transformer available in laboratory. The data for various test cases are captured with the help of DSO, and the collected data has been migrated to computer where the proposed algorithm is examined. After analyzing all the results, it is cleared that the proposed algorithm can prevent transformer isolation during momentary over-fluxing conditions.",

        "Abstract": "Energy forecasting for both consumption and production is a challenging task as it involves many variable factors. It is necessary to calculate the actual production of energy and its consumption as it is very beneficial in maintaining demand and supply. The reliability and smooth functioning of any electrical system are dependent on this management. In this article, the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) based algorithm is used for energy forecasting. The algorithm is used for making three days ahead prediction of energy for both generation and consumption in Estonia. A comparison is also made between our proposed algorithm and the forecasting algorithm used by Estonian energy regulatory authority. The results of both algorithms indicate that our proposed algorithm has lower Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and is giving better forecasting.",

In this paper, we have investigated three types of local descriptors, such as Local Binary Pattern (LBP), Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) and GIST to characterize rice seed images. However, this approach raises the curse of dimensionality phenomenon and needs to select the relevant features for a compact and better representation model. A new ensemble feature selection is proposed to represent all useful information collected from different single feature selection methods. The experimental results have shown the efficiency of our proposed method in terms of accuracy.",

SSR is defined as a condition wherein an electrical network exchanges energy with a turbine generator at one or more of the natural frequencies of the combined systems below its synchronous frequency. The presence of SSR in a system can lead to catastrophic outcomes, and the application of FACTS devices has been found to be one of the most effective approaches to reduce SSR. The study investigates the core concepts associated with FACTS devices and SSR. The concepts underlying SSR interactions, including self-excitation and transient torques, are examined in this study. The study also focuses on the use of FACTS devices in mitigating or eliminating SSR from the system or network of interest. The results of simulations conducted by using eigenvalue analysis and the IEEE second benchmark model are also presented and discussed.",

        "Abstract": "Speed governors have critical importance on hydroelectric power plants, which are adjusted to the rotating speed of hydroelectric generation based on load demand of the grid. The rotating speed is the main factor to balance power generation and load demand. The well-designed controller is needed to control speed governors with high accuracy. A well-defined model is needed to obtain desired control structure. Therefore, in this study, initially, the mathematical model of a hydroelectric power plant is obtained by using physical characteristics of a real-world. Then by using this model and corresponding real-world data, a set of controller parameters is designed by using tuning methodologies based on heuristic optimization algorithms, and their performances are compared with each other and with a classical tuning methodology. Evolutionary-based and nature-inspired-based heuristic optimization algorithms are selected as the tuning algorithms not only to compare the performance of these algorithms with a classical method but also with different origins. The performance of the optimized controller improves the performance of the overall system and helps to get desired performance. The results also indicate that as long as the desired performance criteria are defined as accurate as possible, the performance of the optimization algorithms is acceptable.",

        "Abstract": "The most common failure mode of aluminium electrolytic capacitor is the so-called wear out fault. It is caused by the high core temperature of the capacitor. Therefore, life cycle calculations generally use temperature data to estimate degradation level. Core temperature-based life cycle calculations can consider different current loads on capacitors. The calculation method uses scaling factors for different ripple current waveforms. However, it is not observed that temperature only is responsible for aging, but current waveform also influences the level of degradation. Therefore, sinusoidal and PWM-loaded capacitor tests were performed under the same temperature conditions. The results show that the pore distribution of aluminium anode foil has changed during the test. The pore diameter reduces and it leads to an increase in the ESR value and decrease in the capacitance, electrolyte amount and weight. Comparative results show that the PWM-loaded capacitor is more degraded than the capacitor loaded by sinusoidal test current.",

The main concept of the textile is based on two commercially available LM35DM temperature sensors, knitted electrically conductivity yarns and five areas for press-stud. Three different measurements methods were used in our experiment. Three measurements were performed in the first step, digital thermometer in person’s armpit, contact-less thermometer in the places close to our LM35DM sensors and contact-less thermometer on the forehead. Next, two LM35DM in SOIC8 package were used for temperature measurement within intelligent textile. Finally, the first step was repeated. All measurements were done on ten subjects with their permission to collect body temperature data for scientific purposes. The results show that the average measurement error for first sensor is 0.844°C and 0.278°C for second sensor.",

        "Abstract": "This paper shows the differences in luminous fluxes of two distinguishing dual-layer remote phosphor structures, Flat Dual-Remote Phosphor (FDRP) and Concave Dual-Remote Phosphor (CDRP). The impact of the distance between the two phosphor layers (d_1) and the distance from the phosphor layer to the LED surface (d_2) on the optical properties of the CDRP is also presented. Specifically, when d_1 and d_2 are varied, the scattering and absorption characteristics of the remote phosphor layer change dramatically, which enormously influences the color uniformity and illumination capability of WLEDs. The concentration of YAG:Ce3+ phosphor also needs to be modified so that the correlated color temperature of WLEDs could be maintained at 8500K when d_1 and d_2 are adjusted. In case d_1 = d_2 = 0, the scattering and absorption in the remote phosphor layer are minimal, leading to the infinitesimal color and luminous flux. When d_1 and d_2 get bigger, the scattering surface increases and that the blue and yellow rays are blended becomes more uniform, leading to the minimum white light deviation as well as the lowest luminous flux. According to the studied results, the lumen output can be maximum at 1020lm if d_1 = 0.08mm or d_2 = 0.63mm while the smallest color deviation occurs when d_1 = 0.64mm or d_2 = 1.35mm. Therefore, the researched results will provide further information for choosing the suitable d_1 and d_2 in order to improve the quality of WLEDs.",

The experimental results are compared with the simulations results, based on the solution of Maxwell’s equations using the RF module of COMSOL Multiphysics software. The electric field intensity distribution in the resist layer was analyzed for the mask slits that are larger and comparable to the applied wavelength. The differences in wave energy absorption in the resist layer are presented and discussed. For both cases, the impact of the chromium film thickness of the mask on the pattern profile of the resist is studied and the comparison is performed between the simulation and experimental results.",

        "Abstract": "From the perspective of renewable energy industry investment, absorbing maximum power from renewable sources is a vital factor. Hence, an algorithm is required to change the operating point of renewable energy sources in different environment conditions accordingly. This paper proposes a novel algorithm for tracking the Maximum Power Point (MPP) of a Photovoltaic (PV) panel. In this paper, an auxiliary parameter based on the voltage and power of the PV panel is suggested. By adopting this parameter, independence of irradiation and temperature, the interval between the operating point and the MPP can be estimated. Furthermore, the range of the MPP voltage variations is calculated with respect to various irradiations and temperatures. Then, a novel fuzzy logic Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) algorithm is proposed based on the introduced parameter and voltage variations interval of the MPP. The proposed algorithm has appropriate respond to environment condition changes with proper speed and accuracy. In addition, unlike Hill Climbing (HC) and Perturb and Observe (P&O), the proposed method has no chattering in steady state. The abovementioned claims are successfully validated via the software MATLAB/Simulink.",

        "Abstract": "Flywheel Energy Storage Systems (FESSs) are commonly integrated with wind farms to help them to provide many grid services, including frequency control, voltage control, and power smoothing. Although such systems are not concerned by the severe grid code requirements, their ability to ride-through voltage dips is important to ensure better stability of the power grid. In this paper, the authors propose a robust H∞ current controller for a Wound Rotor Induction Machine (WRIM) based FESS during grid voltage dips. The proposed H∞ controller decreases the negative effects of voltage dips in the WRIM system, such as the rotor over-currents and the active power oscillations. On the other hand, it also guarantees the robustness in the presence of parameter perturbation. The proposed controller is designed using a modified mixed-sensitivity H∞ technique to take into consideration grid disturbances and parameter perturbation. Finally, simulations are made in MATLAB/Simulink using SimPowerSystems to verify the effectiveness of the H∞ controller under grid voltage dips with WRIM parameter perturbation. The simulation results show that the proposed H∞ controller can improve the stability of the WRIM based FESS subject to grid voltage dips and guarantee the robustness with parameter perturbation.",

        "Abstract": "The paper proposes a Fast ReRoute model with the realization of path and bandwidth protection scheme, which can be used in MPLS for SDN. The task of calculating the set of disjoint primary and backup paths during fast rerouting was reduced to solving the optimization problem of Integer Linear Programming. The advantage of the proposed solution is the possibility of implementing 1:1, 1:2, …, 1:n path protection schemes without the introduction of an additional set of control (routing) variables, which contributes to reducing the dimension of the optimization problem being solved and the computational complexity of its practical implementation. The criterion of optimality of routing solutions contributes to the formation of the primary and backup disjoint paths with the highest possible bandwidth. In this case, the path with the maximum bandwidth will correspond to the primary path, while the remaining paths will be used as backup ones in decreasing order of their bandwidth. The total number of calculated disjoint paths depends on the selected redundancy scheme. The study conducted showed the efficiency and adequacy of the proposed Fast ReRoute model when using various redundancy schemes.",

        "Abstract": "The paper presents histogram-based initialzation of Fuzzy C Means (FCM) clustering algorithm for remote sensing image analysis. The drawback of well known FCM clustering is sensitive to the choice of initial cluster centers. In order to overcome this drawback, the proposed algorithm, first, determines the optimal initial cluster centers by maximizing the histogram-based weight function. By using these initial cluster centers, the given image is segmented using fuzzy clustering. The major contribution of the proposed method is the automatic initialization of the cluster centers and hence, the clustering performance is enhanced. Also, it is empirically free of experimentally set parameters. Experiments are performed on remote sensing images and cluster validity indices Davies-Bouldin, Partition index, Xie-Beni, Partition Coefficient and Partition Entropy are computed and compared with prominent methods such as FCM, K-Means, and automatic histogram based FCM. The experimental outcomes show that the proposed method is competent for remote sensing image segmentation.",

        "Abstract": "A simple Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI) based on a standard single-mode fiber for simultaneous strain and temperature sensing was proposed and demonstrated experimentally. The interferometer was fabricated by electrical arc discharge method in which a portion of the standard single-mode fiber was heated and stretched. Any special type of fiber or a particular splicer was not required to form the MZI and it indicated high resolution. To find the modes that contributed to the interference spectrum, Fourier analysis was done and the spatial frequency versus normalized intensity plot showed that LP02 was the excited dominant higher order cladding mode. Coefficient matrix was realized for simultaneous measurement of strain and temperature ability of such an MZI. For discrete measurements, a resolution of 0.79 °C in temperature and 1.18 micro-strain can be achieved for 10 pm wavelength resolution. This extremely simple, low-cost sensor easily fabricated with good repeatability is a good candidate in diverse sensing applications.",

The model parameters for consideration of loss and dynamic performance of the motor are estimated by using Genetic Algorithm (GA). Also, synthesized winding current waveforms based on a~superposition method and frequency domain of known harmonic voltages are investigated. The methodology of the proposed GA applied to parameter estimation of the unsymmetrical two-phase induction motor is fully given. Carrier-based unbalanced Space Vector Pulse With Modulation (SVPWM) is employed and implemented on a~low-cost microcontroller.  In order to prove the validity of the model with the parameters obtained by GA, performance comparison with the experiment and the model with the parameters obtained by conventional test in laboratory has been made. The results of simulation with the proposed parameters and experiment are in good agreement.",

In this context, this paper deals with a modified three-level Z-source NPC inverter topology with simplified command to generate shoot-through states and reduce switching losses. For this reason, an extra power switch Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistor (IGBT) is added to insert shoot-through, thus eliminating the need for full-shoot-through on any of the three branches of the inverter. On the other hand, a modified Space Vector Modulation (SVM) strategy is proposed. This gives a number of benefits, both in terms of implementation and harmonic performance.

This technique uses gain normalization in the frequency locked-loop. This increases the computational complexity. In this paper, we propose an alternative implementation to reduce the computational complexity of the SOGI-FLL. The proposed implementation modifies mainly the frequency locked-loop part and requires normalized voltage measurement. dSPACE 1104 board-based hardware implementation shows that the proposed implementation executes 20% faster than the standard implementation. This could be very beneficial for high switching frequency application e.g. >= 1MHz. In addition to the nominal frequency case, multi-resonant implementation is also proposed to tackle grid harmonics using a~simpler harmonic decoupling network. Small signal dynamical modeling and tuning are performed for both implementations. Dynamical equivalence is also established between the two implementations. Experimental comparative analysis demonstrates similar or better performance (depending on test scenarios) with respect to the standard implementation of the SOGI-FLL.",

        "Abstract": "This paper introduces the concept of Small Cell Cloud (SCC) composed of multiple Cloud-enabled Small Cells (CeSCs), which provide radio connection for mobile User Equipment (UE) such as smart-phones or wearables such as smart glasses. Moreover, CeSCs host computations offloaded from UEs in a way similar to centralized cloud, yet different in its proximity to users. Proposed client-server architecture of SCC conveys mechanisms for moving offloaded computations from the UEs to CeSCs. Real-life implementation of the SCC architecture relies on custom-developed Offloading Framework which is responsible for low-level communication between the UE and the SCC. The Offloading Framework is accompanied by an Augmented Reality (AR) app, which employs intensive computations for discovery of places of interest. Such app is latency-sensitive, a~criterion which makes computation offloading beneficial due to its ability to decrease latency. The combination of the Offloading Framework and the AR app makes up an SCC testbed used for further performance evaluation. Numerous measurements are carried out to examine the impact of various parameters. Based on Proof-of-concept implementation and thorough measurements, it has been revealed that computation offloading can decrease overall latency as much as to 47% and energy consumption on the UE side to 56%.",

        "Abstract": "Performance of Multicarrier Multicode Code-Division Multiple Access (MC/MCD-CDMA) systems can be improved significantly by using Wavelet Packets (WPs) as subcarriers instead of a~sinusoidal function. This is because WPs have much lower sidelobes and negligible sidelobe energy leakage compared to sinusoidal carriers; this property significantly decreases the intercarrier interference and improves the system performance. Further improvement can be achieved by utilizing multiple antennas at transmitter and receiver to construct a~Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) system. Channel hardening is the main drawback of MIMO systems. Antenna selection can be employed to reduce this problem. In this paper, we use the antenna selection in MIMO WP-MC/MCD-CDMA system. These combinations of antenna selection, MIMO, and WP in MC/MCD-CDMA improve the system performance significantly and reduce the channel hardening. The performance of the system is tested according to the outage probability and bit error rate. Two MIMO schemes on Nakagami-m fading channel are considered, which are: selective transmit /selective receive and selective transmit /maximum ratio combining receive. The study includes the effects antennas' number, fading parameter-m, number of users, and the threshold signal to interferences plus noise ratio. The performance of the system is compared to that of MC/MCD-CDMA based on a~sinusoidal carrier. The results reveal that: by increasing antennas' number, the system performance is improved significantly, and MC/MCD-CDMA system based on WPs carriers outperforms MC/MCD-CDMA system based on a~sinusoidal carrier.",

As a first step, this contribution analyzes the possibility to transcode reference images of three well-known image databases, i.e. IRCCyN/IVC, LIVE and TID2013, from their original, older formats to HEVC; thus creating a homogeneous database of 327 HEVC encoded images accompanied with bitstream parameters and values obtained from objective and subjective assessments. Secondly, it analyzes some of the HEVC intra coding parameters regarding their influence on the image quality by using machine learning, namely Support Vector Machine - Regression.",

In this paper, a~novel dynamic comparator is proposed to reduce latch delay and offset. The comparator benefits from add-on cross-coupled transistors in latch structure and unbalanced clocks to enhance comparison speed and to lessen input offset voltage occurred due to mismatch in cross-coupled circuits in latch stage. The derivations for delay and input offset voltage are presented for proposed dynamic comparator with meticulous Monte-Carlo simulations. The results are verified by simulations in CADENCE SPECTRE at 1V supply voltage and 90nm CMOS technology. A~comparative analysis between the proposed dynamic comparator and the previous reported comparators has been presented. It is observed that the delay is reduced up to 46% and 6% as compared to conventional and two phase dynamic comparator, respectively. Moreover, the proposed design consumes 53.36muW power only. The Monte-Carlo simulation shows that the standard deviation of input offset voltage is 10.8~mV which is 12% and 77% of conventional and two phase dynamic comparator, respectively.",

The proposed fuzzy controller  is able to pilot the states of the buck converter to track a  reference model. The T-S fuzzy model is employed, firstly, to represent exactly the dynamics of the nonlinear buck converter system, and then the considered controller is designed on the basis of  a  concept called Virtual Desired Variables (VDVs). In this case, a two-stage design procedure is developed: i) determine the reference model according to the desired output voltage, ii) determine the fuzzy controller gains by solving a set of Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMIs). A digital implementation of the proposed T-S fuzzy controller is carried out using the ATmega328P-based Microcontroller of the Arduino Uno  board. Simulations and experimental results demonstrate the validity and effectiveness of the  proposed control scheme.",

The coil parameter discussed in the paper is the angle between the windings. The research method is based on analyzing the magnetic path of DC electromagnetic actuator and on comparison of analytically obtained results with the numerical simulation results. Transient numerical simulation of DC electromagnetic actuator has been performed on the 2D axial-symmetric model using the Finite Element Method (FEM). The main contribution is the coil winding angle impact on the force of DC electromagnetic actuator. The results showed that, by reducing the coil winding angle, it is possible to increase the electromagnetic force, reduce the coil dimensions, and thus the dimensions of electromagnetic actuator.",

        "Abstract": "This paper presents an improved single-phase Multilevel Inverter (MLI) which is conceptualized to reduce power switches along with separate DC voltage sources. Compared with recent modular topologies, the proposed MLI employs a reduced number of components. The proposed inverter consists of a combination of two circuits, i.e., the level generation and polarity generation parts. The level generation part is used to synthesize different output voltage levels, while the polarity inversion is performed by a~conventional H-bridge circuit. The performance of the proposed topology has been studied using s single-phase seven-level inverter, which utilizes seven power switches and three independent DC voltage sources. Model Predictive Control (MPC) is applied to inject a sinusoidal current into the utility grid which exhibits low Total Harmonic Distortion (THD). Tests, including a~change in grid current amplitude as well as operation under variation in Power Factor (PF), have been performed to validate the good performance obtained using MPC. The effectiveness of the proposed seven-level inverter has been verified theoretically using MATLAB Simulink. In addition, Real-Time (RT) validation using the dSPACE-CP1103 has been performed to confirm the system performance and system operation using digital platforms. Simulation and RT results show improved THD at 1.23% of injected current.",

Adaptive model selection procedures, based on the shrinkage weighted least squares estimates, are proposed. The comparison between shrinkage and least squares methods is studied and the advantages of the shrinkage methods are analyzed. Estimation properties for proposed statistical algorithms are studied on the basis of the robust mean square accuracy defined as the maximum mean square estimation error over all possible values of unknown noise parameters. Sharp oracle inequalities for the robust risks have been obtained. The robust efficiency of the model selection procedure has been established.",

A TRMS serves  as a suitable laboratory-based  platform to evaluate the performance of control algorithms for  complex Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) systems such as rotocraft.\r\nIn the proposed scheme, an ISM enhancement to an LQG has been introduced, which attempts to overcome modelling inaccuracies and uncertainties. The novelty of the proposed control law lies in hybridizing a robust control approach with an optimal control law to achieve improved performance. Experimental results on the TRMS demonstrate that the ISM-LQG strategy significantly improves the tracking performance of the TRMS pitch and hence confirm the applicability and efficiency of the proposed scheme.",

        "Abstract": "This paper presents utility for the design of the cross-coupled charge pump, which is used for supplying peripherals with low current consumption on the chip, as the EEPROM or FLASH memories. The article summarizes the knowledge in the field of the theoretical and practical analysis of the cross-coupled charge pump (design relationships and their connection with the pump parameters, as the threshold voltage, power supply voltage, clock signal frequency, etc.) that are applicated in the design algorithm. Optimal MOSFETs sizes (W, L) were find based on the construct of the time response characteristics of the pump sub-block and finding of the maximal voltage increase in the active interval of the clock signal and minimizing of the pump losses, as the switch reverse current, inverter cross current, etc. Synthesis process includes the design of the pump functional blocks with dominant real properties, which are described based on BSIM equations for long channel MOSFET. The pump stage complex model is applicated for estimation of the number of pump stages via state-space model description and using of the interpolation polynomial functions in the algorithm. It involves the construction of the time response characteristic due to the state variables and prediction of the number of the pump stages for the next cycle based on the previous data. Optimization of the pump area is based on the minimizing of the main capacitor in each of the pump stages (number of the pump stages must be increased to obtain the desired output voltage value.) Access is designed to stress the maximum pump voltage efficiency. The whole procedure is summarized in the practical example, in which the solution is shown both in terms of maximal voltage efficiency and the optimal pump area on a chip with respect to the clock signal frequency. Added functions of the design environment are explained, inclusive of the designed pump netlist generating for professional design environment Mentor Graphics including the real models of components that are available in library MGC Design Kit. The procedure gives designer credible results without long timeconsuming optimization process. In addition, the complex model allows the inclusion effects of higher-levels.",

This study proposes novel ternary gates based on two supply voltages in which the direct current is eliminated and the leakage current is reduced considerably. In addition, ST-OR and ST-AND are generated directly instead of ST-NAND and ST-NOR. The proposed gates have a high noise margin near V_(DD)/4. The simulation results indicated that the power consumption and PDP underwent a~sharp decrease and noise margin showed a considerable increase in comparison to both one supply and two supply based designs in previous works. PDP is improved in the proposed OR, as compared to one supply and two supply based previous works about 83% and 63%, respectively. Also, a memory cell is designed using the proposed STI logic gate, which has a considerably lower static power to store logic ‘1’ and the static noise margin, as compared to other designs.",

        "Abstract": "Heart disease classification plays an important role in clinical diagnoses. The performance improvement of an Electrocardiogram classifier is therefore of great relevance, but it is a challenging task too. This paper proposes a novel classification algorithm using the kernel method. A kernel is constructed based on wavelet coefficients of heartbeat signals for a classifier with high performance. In particular, a wavelet packet decomposition algorithm is applied to heartbeat signals to obtain the Approximation and Detail coefficients, which are used to calculate the parameters of the kernel. A principal component analysis algorithm with the wavelet-based kernel is employed to choose the main features of the heartbeat signals for the input of the classifier. In addition, a neural network with three hidden layers in the classifier is utilized for classifying five types of heart disease. The electrocardiogram signals in nine patients obtained from the MIT-BIH database are used to test the proposed classifier. In order to evaluate the performance of the classifier, a multi-class confusion matrix is applied to produce the performance indexes, including the Accuracy, Recall, Precision, and F1 score. The experimental results show that the proposed method gives good results for the classification of the five mentioned types of heart disease.",

We used our own advanced ECG Holter device and EEG helmet to record the heart and brain activity impacted by different environments, materials, colors or body positions during work. In this paper, we want to show the interactions between humans and architecture design, which modify human work performance and well-being. This paper is a conclusion of the 3 different pilot studies, where different scopes of human-space interaction were explored. In the experiments, we aimed mostly at wood materials and their beneficial effects on the nervous system. The research in its actual state is primarily focused on optimizing the methods of the ECG data analysis from our Holter device and the EEG data from helmet. Based on these data, we will improve the methodology of the experiments for the next enhanced research with aspiration to automate data analysi",

This paper deals with registration of two sets of line segments, which is especially useful in mapping applications. Our method is non-iterative, finding an optimal transformation in a single step, in a time proportional only to a number of the corresponding line segments. The procedure also provides diagnostic measures of reliability of the computation and of similarity of the data sets being registered. At this point, the method presumes known correspondences, which is limiting, but the discussion, in the end, reveals some possibilities to overcome this issue. Practical properties are demonstrated on a typical task of localization of a robot with a known map.",

        "Abstract": "The main objective for a watermarking technique is to attain imperceptibility, robustness and security against various malicious attacks applied by illicit users. To fulfil these basic requirements for a scheme is a big issue of concern. So, in this paper, a new image watermarking method is proposed which utilizes properties of homomorphic transform, Redundant Discrete Wavelet Transform (RDWT), Arnold Transform (AT) along with Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to attain these required properties. RDWT is performed on host image to achieve LL subband. This LL subband image is further decomposed into illumination and reflectance components by homomorphic transform. In order to strengthen security of proposed scheme, AT is used to scramble watermark. This scrambled watermark is embedded with Singular Values (SVs) of reflectance component which are obtained by applying SVD to it. Since reflectance component contains important features of image, therefore, embedding of watermark in this part provides excellent imperceptibility. Proposed scheme is comprehensively examined against different attacks like scaling, shearing etc. for its robustness. Comparative study with other prevailing algorithms clearly reveals superiority of proposed scheme in terms of robustness and imperceptibility.",

The stress-induced birefringence of the polymethylmetacrylate samples was experimentally investigated by an apparatus combining an in-house made plane polariscope with a machine for fatigue testing of materials. A halogen lamp was used as the source of white light. The polariscope’s basis was formed by two sets of plane polarizers, one designed for visible (470-750) nm and another one for near-infrared (900-1800) nm spectral range, respectively. The investigated sample was placed between the polarizers and light that passed through the polariscope was collected by an optical fiber connected to an appropriate optical spectral analyzer. The spectra of transmitted light were measured as a function of load and their analysis provided information on the load-induced birefringence of the investigated polymethylmetacrylate samples.",

        "Abstract": "We present a new technique for modification of diffraction and optical properties of photonic devices by surface application of polymer Three-Dimensional (3D) woodpile Photonic Crystal (PhC) structure. Woodpile structure based on IP-Dip polymer was designed and fabricated by Direct Laser Writing (DLW) lithography method based on nonlinear Two-Photon Absorption (TPA). At first, we investigated diffraction properties of woodpile structure with a period of 2 μm. The structure was placed on a glass substrate, and diffraction patterns were measured using laser sources with different wavelengths. After diffraction properties investigation, the fabricated structures were used in optoelectronic devices by their surface application. Our polymer 3D PhC woodpile structures were used for radiation properties modification of light emitting devices - optical fiber and Light Emitting Diode (LED) and for angular photoresponse modification of InGaAsN-based photodiode. The modification of the far-field radiation patterns of optical fiber and LED and spatial modulation of light coupling into photodiode chip with applied structures were measured by goniophotometer. Quality of fabricated structures was analyzed by a Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM).",

The objective is to minimize harmonic distortion in inverter output voltage supply to a Single Phase Induction Motor (SPIM). Here, the output of a variable duty cycle buck DC-DC converter is fed to an H-bridge inverter to generate a very close sinusoidal output voltage. Few power semiconductor switches are utilized to produce inverter output voltage with reduced harmonic distortion comparable with results achieved in multilevel inverters. The SPIM was analysed in the stationary d-q reference frame while the buck converter was operated in the Continuous Conduction Mode (CCM) to ensure that the output voltage vary exactly as the duty cycle. The simulation results show good starting transient characteristics for the SPIM and also stable operation under intermittent loading of 4 N-m. The average inverter output voltage of 157.4 V was achieved with Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) as low as 6.32%. This configuration is simple, cheap, and has reduced control complexity.",

The optimal designs were developed using the response surface methodology and Finite Element Method (FEM). Three closed rotor slot geometries, namely closed, round, and oval were investigated through FEM calculation and validated by experimental measurement for improving starting performance parameters such as starting current, starting torque, magnetic flux linkage in starting condition, and efficiency. In this study, a starting performance analysis, including the alternative equivalent circuit method and flux linkage FEM analysis, was employed. The results show that among the three slot geometries, the optimal design of the circular closed rotor slot produces the lowest rotor leakage reactance and the highest magnetic flux linkage, starting torque, and efficiency. A comparison between the simulation and experimental results validated the accuracy of the proposed model with percentage error being approximately 8%.",

The model also takes into account the fuzzy limitation of the permissible ice melting power associated with the uncertainty of weather conditions.

        "Abstract": "In the recent years, several research works are focusing on the use of STATCOM in electrical networks because it is used to regulate the voltage, to improve the dynamic stability of the power system besides allowing better management of the power flow. All these positive tasks have guaranteed an important position of STATCOM within a family of Flexible Alternating Current Transmission System (FACTS). In this paper study, the control and operation of a three levels 48-pulse GTO based STATCOM is implemented with series connected transformers. The system may, unfortunately, be prone to GTO switch faults and therefore may affect reactive power transiting. In this paper, a new diagnostic approach is proposed based on the Single-Sided Amplitude Spectrum (SSAS) method of the three-leg converter currents for detection and localization of open-circuit faults. The integration of the STATCOM reconfigurable fault tolerant to the system is also considered to ensure service continuity. Several results are presented and discussed in this paper to illustrate the performance of the STATCOM fault-tolerant diagnostic.",

        "Abstract": "Passive methods of islanding detection have the advantage of not perturbing the system, but they suffer from large Non-Detection Zone (NDZ) and unpredictable detection time. In this paper, a new passive scheme for islanding detection, based on estimating a new index derived from summation of impedance values in all frequencies along the time at the Point of Common Coupling (PCC), is introduced using Fast Discrete S-Transform (FDST) method. The proposed method maintains both time and frequency information and as a result, helps to decrease the detection time. A frequency dependent model is proposed for characterizing the interconnection changes when islanding happens. The Cumulative Impedance Index (CII) is proposed to discriminate between islanding condition and normal operation. This technique is combined with under/over voltage protection method to decrease NDZ. Simulations for different conditions of normal and islanding operations verify the proposed algorithm. In all cases, islanding is detected within 0.01 s, and NDZ is decreased to 1% of power mismatch between local load and Distributed Generator (DG) output. The results demonstrate the capability of the method to islanding detection with minimum delay and least NDZ.",

Hexagonal planar antennas also suffer from high cross polar levels. This paper proposes a method to overcome impedance mismatch and to increase co-polarization level by reducing ground plane. Vertex feeding is demonstrated in this paper to establish improvement in impedance values more clearly. The impedance at any vertex of a hexagonal patch is too high when compared to the characteristic impedance of the probe. Three vertex-fed hexagonal antennas are developed to demonstrate the effect of ground plane reduction within C-Band. The proposed technique can be optimized to match the impedance and achieve good return loss where monopole radiation characteristics are not an issue. A vertex-fed reduced ground hexagonal antenna is proposed here that operates around 5 GHz with a frequency span of 600 MHz. Thus, the proposed antenna is quite suitable for indoor wireless LAN (UNII-1) applications.",

        "Abstract": "When it comes to indoor Real-Time Location Systems (RTLS) for an Automatic Guided Vehicle (AGV), the most important factor is to minimize the location estimation error. In industrial sites, centimetre-level accuracy is required for the AGV. Since the duration for measuring the position of an AGV is slower than the speed of arriving RF signals, the margin of error inevitably becomes larger than in systems that use low-speed media such as ultrasonic waves. To minimize such errors, a short-range location estimation Recursive RF Active Echo (RRFAE) algorithm is presented. Increasing the time ratio by repeatedly and interactively reflecting the signal can reduce measurement error. That is, there is an effect of expanding the measurement distance by the number of iterations. We propose and implement a precise positioning algorithm in an indoor environment where many reflections exist. The error analysis of the RRFAE algorithm after hardware correction shows that the level of the RRFAE's errors is only one tenth that of an RTLS system that uses other RF signals.",

The simulation result gives minimum operating voltage required as 0.25 V for which all transistors work in their respective region of operation. For the supply range of 0.25-1 V, the obtained mean voltage reference is 100.4 mV with the line regulation of 0.186 mV/V. The temperature coefficient (TC) of 51ppm/°C is achieved for a wide temperature range of -50 to 135°C with the given minimal operating supply voltage. The power dissipation for minimal supply voltage at room temperature is 33 nW. The proposed VRC exhibits a high PSRR of -52.5 dB at 100Hz and -29 dB at 1 MHz.",

The Min-Sum algorithm mainly uses the process of finding the minimum and addition. Hence the number of multiplications is drastically reduced which helps in reducing the complexity of implementation. Adding an optimisation factor to the decoder increases the accuracy and reduces the number of iterations required to compute the decoded message. Hence the process of optimisation reduces the overall decoding time required. Modified Min-Sum algorithm is proposed to further improve the performance by decreasing the number of stages in the decoding process which reduces the complexity in Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) implementation.",

        "Abstract": "Clinical retinal image analysis is an import aspect of clinical diagnosis in ophthalmology. Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP) represents one of the most severe retinal disorders in prematurely born infants. One of the ROP clinical signs is the presence of retinal lesions endangering the vision system. Unfortunately, the stage and progress of these findings is often only subjectively estimated. A procedure such as this is undoubtedly linked to subjective inaccuracies depending on the experience of the ophthalmologist. In our study, a fully autonomous segmentation algorithm to model retinal lesions found using RetCam 3 is proposed. The proposed method used a combination of retinal image preprocessing and active contours for retinal lesion segmentation. Based on this procedure, a binary model of retinal lesions that allowed retinal lesions to be classified from a retinal image background was obtained. Another important aspect of the model was feature extraction. These features reliably and automatically described the development stage of an individual lesion. A complex procedure such as this has significant implications for ophthalmic clinical practice in substituting manual clinical procedures and improving the accuracy of routine clinical decisions.",

This assessment is based on code analysis focused mainly on the error probability calculation. The results published in the practical part are obtained using a model created in Matlab environment, in which the chosen convolutional structures were tested. These tests were focused on the transmission error probability analysis provided by a binary symmetric channel, and also on optimization of other parameters affecting the residual error in the decoding algorithm. The results are generalized into concept of methodology for the convolutional codes safety assessment in compliance with standards for safety-related applications.",

        "Abstract": "In comparison with the conformal phosphor or in-cup phosphor structure, remote phosphor structure has a superior luminous flux whereas its color quality is inferior to the others’. Due to this drawback, it is essential to conduct experiments to find the solution for the improvement of the color quality of WLEDs using remote phosphor structure. In this study, a dual-layer remote phosphor structure that is capable of enhancing the Color Rendering Index (CRI) and Color Quality Scale (CQS) for WLEDs was proposed. Three kinds of WLEDs with the similar structures but different color temperatures varying at 5600 K, 7000 K, and 8500 K are used in this article. The mission of this paper is to place a yellow-green emitting SrBaSiO4:Eu2+ phosphor layer or a red-emitting SrwFxByOz:Eu2+,Sm2+ phosphor layer on the YAG:Ce3+ phosphor layer and then select the most appropriate value of SrwFxByOz:Eu2+,Sm2+ concentration to get the greatest color quality. Experimental results were exactly as expected since SrwFxByOz:Eu2+,Sm2+ really succeeded in increasing CRI and CQS. Specifically, the larger the SrwFxByOz:Eu2+,Sm2+ concentration, the higher the CRI and CQS, resulting from the increase of the red light component in WLEDs. Meanwhile, the quality degree of luminous flux depends tightly on the SrBaSiO4:Eu2+ phosphor layer. However, if the SrwFxByOz:Eu2+,Sm2+ and SrBaSiO4:Eu2+ concentration exceeds, the luminous flux and color quality will have a tendency to drop off thanks to the theory of Mie scattering and the Lambert-Beer law. The result of this paper is a valuable reference in the production of high-quality WLEDs.",

        "Abstract": "This study presents a filterless and sensorless commutation method for low-voltage brushless DC motors. The proposed method utilizes controlled DC-link inverter instead of the Pulse-Width Modulation (PWM) scheme. Therefore, motor voltages and currents become free from the high-frequency noise of PWM switching, thereby decreasing motor losses. Consequently, the method does not require any Low-Pass Filter (LPF) and it does not involve speed-dependent phase delay caused by the LPF. However, current commutation deteriorates waveform of line voltages. Thus, specific functions are defined to compensate for the current commutation spikes and remove false zero-crossing points of line voltages. Furthermore, the use of unfiltered line voltages eliminates the requirement of any phase shifter. Hence, the main superiority of the proposed method over preceding sensorless commutation methods is the simultaneous elimination of the phase shifter and LPF, which makes the method simple and cost-effective. The simulation and experimental results show the effectiveness and validity of the method.",

In the master stage, the total power generated by each Distributed Generator (DG) is determined by the BHO, while the slave strategy is entrusted with solving the resulting conventional power flow problem via a classical Gauss-Seidel (GS) numerical method. For comparison purposes, this work uses nonlinear optimization methods available in General Algebraic Modeling System (GAMS) as well as continuous metaheuristic optimization techniques. Two test feeders with 21 and 69 nodes were considered for validating the proposed hybrid BHO-GS optimization method, which enables to demonstrate its applicability, robustness and efficiency compared to conventional approaches. The results of all the simulations were obtained via MATLAB 2017a.",

        "Abstract": "Discovering periodic patterns in a customer transaction database is the task of identifying itemsets (sets of items or values) that periodically appear in a sequence of transactions. \r\nNumerous methods can identify patterns exhibiting a periodic behavior. Nonetheless, a problem of these traditional approaches is that the concept of periodic behavior is defined very strictly. Indeed, a pattern is considered to be periodic if the amount of time or number of transactions between all pairs of its consecutive occurrences is less than a fixed maxPer (maximum periodicity) threshold. As a result, a pattern can be eliminated by a traditional algorithm for mining periodic patterns even if all of its periods but one respect the maxPer constraint. Consequently, many patterns that are almost always periodic are not presented to the user. But these patterns could be considered as interesting as they generally appear periodically. To address this issue, this paper suggests to use three measures to identify periodic patterns. These measures are named average, maximum and minimum periodicity, respectively. They are each designed to evaluate a different aspect of the periodic behavior of patterns. By using them together in a novel algorithm called  Periodic Frequent Pattern Miner, more flexibility is given to users to select patterns meeting specific periodic requirements. The designed algorithm has been evaluated on several datasets. Results show that the proposed solution is scalable, efficient, and can identify a small sets of patterns compared to the Eclat algorithm for mining all frequent patterns in a database.",

        "Abstract": "This study is related to SLAM, also known simultaneous localization and mapping which is highly important and an indispensable issue for autonomous mobile robots. Both an environment mapping and an agent’s localization are provided with SLAM systems. However, while performing SLAM for an unknown environment, the robot is navigated by three different ways: a user guidance, random movements on an exploration mode or exploration algorithms. A user guidance or random exploration methods have some drawbacks that a user may not be able to observe the agent or random process may take a long time. In order to answer these problems, it is searched for a new and autonomous exploration algorithm for SLAM systems. In this manner, a new kind of left-orientated autonomous exploration algorithm for SLAM systems has been improved. To show the algorithm effectiveness, a factory-like environment is made up on the ROS (Robot Operating System) platform and navigation of the agent is observed. The result of the study demonstrates that it is possible to perform SLAM autonomously in any similar environment without the need of the user interference.",

        "Abstract": "Children suffering from asthma are often undiagnosed or misdiagnosed as their symptoms are similar to other respiratory conditions. Spirometry, the \"golden\" pulmonary function test used for asthma diagnosis, is often unsuitable for young children since it requires them to perform extreme inhalation and exhalation maneuvers. Impulse Oscillometry (IOS) is an effortless, child-friendly, sensitive, and reliable testing technique that could be used in the effective diagnosis of asthma. However, the IOS requires a deep understanding of the mechanical and/or equivalent electrical circuit models of the human respiratory system, which hinders its broad acceptance and utility in clinics. This paper presents a data characterization study based on the statistical assessment of the IOS parameters. The main focus is to investigate four different manifestations of pulmonary conditions in children due to peripheral obstruction: Asthma (A), Small Airway Impairment (SAI), Possible Small Airway Impairment (PSAI), and Normal (N). The objective of this investigation is to pave the way for the feature selection stage of our future computer-aided classification work to distinguish between lung dysfunction and healthy lung function in children by identifying those IOS parameters that are most sensitive to discriminate between the different respiratory conditions mentioned above. Our ultimate goal is to facilitate the interpretation of the impulse oscillometric test results and provide clinicians with a reliable and proven method for accurate classification of children's lung function for an early asthma detection, diagnosis, and control.",

White LEDs have excellent illumination properties but their communication properties need improvement. This article proposes a way how to evade the communication limitations of white LEDs. A part of original white LED spectrum is suppressed by an optical filter. Then the suppressed part is replaced by another LED. The correct choice of suitable LED enables to reconstruct the original spectrum. This solution removes the limitations because the white LED emits continuously. Data are carried by the communication LED only. The evaluation of reconstruction of original white light is measurement of the colour coordinates x and y. Furthermore, the communication properties of this transmitter were tested and obtained results are shown in this paper. EVM parameter was measured.",

        "Abstract": "One of the crucial goals often thought of in connection with remote phosphors is to make the emitted photon larger than other structures. However, the two biggest hurdles that make achieving the goals more challenging are color uniformity and Color Rendering Index (CRI). This is the reason why people have started to pay more attention to these issues in recent research papers. Thus, this study will present the idea of controlling the distance between phosphor layers to control the optical parameters of White light LED (WLED). Based on the Mie scattering theory, which is about absorption and scattering of plane electromagnetic waves by uniform isotropic particles of the simplest form (sphere, infinite cylinder) which are in a uniform and isotropic dielectric infinite medium, the results of the study are confirmed to be completely accurate and reliable. Specifically, when d = 0.64 mm, the flux can increase to 9.7% compared to the original. Similarly, when d = 0.84 mm, the color uniformity can be double better meanwhile the CRI value is kept intact. Once fully calculated and substantiated, the paper will provide comparable results in practice for the production of higher quality WLED.",

        "Abstract": "Clean energy sources like wind energy have received great attention due to growing demand for electrical energy and increase of environmental pollution. The Doubly Fed Induction Generators (DFIGs) are also in common use due to their ability to control the reactive power with no need for capacitor banks. Existence of active and reactive power controllers in DFIG may provide the possibility of adverse interaction with torsional modes of the turbine-generator set. Because of the importance of this phenomenon, in this paper, the interaction of DFIG controllers with other components of the wind turbine-generator, especially torsional modes, has been studied. As the variable speed wind turbine is used, the effects of rotor speed variation on the torsional interaction with the active and reactive power controllers have been investigated. Moreover, the effects of variation of other parameters such as local load, and mechanical and electrical parameters of DFIG on the torsional interaction have been studied. In order to study and analyze this phenomenon, the linear modal analysis is used. The obtained results demonstrate the effects of parameters in possible occurrence of interaction between the DFIG controllers and the DFIG turbine generator set. In addition, the obtained analytical results are verified via time domain simulation.",

        "Abstract": "In this paper, we present the modeling and control of a grid connected Variable Speed Wind Energy Conversion System (VS-WECS) based on a Direct Driven Permanent Magnet Synchronous Generator (DD-PMSG). A new robust control has been proposed and utilized to operate the wind turbine so as to extract the maximum power from the wind energy and to ensure a unit power factor. This control is known as the Active Disturbance Rejection Control (ADRC) and it is based on the Extended State Observer (ESO). It consists in controlling, through the stator currents, the machine side converter in order to adapt the rotational speed of the generator to the different wind speed profiles (Maximum Power Point Tracking MPPT). In addition, it ensures the control of the DC bus voltage and the exchange of active and reactive powers between the wind turbine and the electrical power grid. In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed control a series of simulations are made under the MATLAB/SIMULINK environment. The results obtained by simulation show that the proposed strategy is efficient in terms of stability and precision as well as for the robustness with regard to the internal disturbances when variying the parameters of the machine.",

This approach is based on the optimization of the control voltage magnitude of a brushless excitation synchronous alternator machine operating at variable speed. The choice of the machine type is justified by its attractiveness in several areas such as the aircraft domain due to its autonomy and robustness. The considered control technique is based on the simultaneous optimization of two regulators introduced in the loop control. The parameters of the Proportional Integral Derivatives (PID) regulator have been optimized using the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), which is considered as an attractive method considering the wide operating speed range, and the load variations compared with the classical methods such as Ziegler Nichols. Many robustness tests are carried out by considering the parameters variations as well as the perturbation connection and disconnection of the load at low and high speeds.",

An approximation based on the definition of the Laplace transformation is used to obtain initial values of the parameters. These values are utilized to simulate sensorless control structures of the induction motor drive in Matlab-Simulink environment. Performance comparison of two typical observers is carried out at different speed areas and in presence of parameter uncertainty. A laboratory stand with the induction motor drive and load unit is set up to verify the properties of observers. Experimental results confirm the expected dynamic properties of selected observer.",

In this paper, a new adaptive SOSMC scheme is proposed for mismatched uncertain systems in which these above assumptions are required. In this proposed method, only output variables are used in the sliding surface and controller design. The advantage of no need of all state variables in controller design makes the method more useful and realistic since it can be applied to a wider class of systems. Finally, a vertical take-off and landing aircraft at the nominal airspeed of 135~knots is simulated to demonstrate the advantages and effectiveness of the proposed approach.",

Fuzzy logic systems are used to adapt the unknown switching-gains to eliminate the chattering phenomenon induced by Sliding Mode Control (SMC).

The aim of DED is to optimize dynamically the active power of generating units over operating time considering practical constraints such as valve point effect, prohibited zones, ramp rate limits and total power losses. In order to overcome the drawback of the two standard metaheuristics such as Firefly Algorithm (FA) and Time Varying Acceleration based Particle Swarm Optimization (PSOTVAC), a hybrid method called FAPSOTVAC is proposed to improve the solution of DED. The main idea introduced towards combining FA and PSOTVAC is to create a flexible equilibrium between exploration and exploitation during search process. The robustness of the proposed hybrid method is validated on many practical power systems (10 and 30 units) to minimize the total fuel cost considering all practical constraints. The results found prove the efficiency of the proposed FAPSOTVAC in terms of solution quality and convergence characteristics.",

The GWO algorithm is based on meta-heuristic method, and it has been proven to give very competitive results in different optimization problems. First, by using the proposed technique, the system independent variables such as the generators’ power outputs as well as the associated dependent variables like the bus voltage magnitudes, transformer tap setting and shunt VAR compensators values are optimized to meet the power system operation requirements. The Optimal power flow study is then performed to assess the impact of variable wind power generation on system parameters. Two standard power systems IEEE30 and IEEE57 are used to test and verify the effectiveness of the proposed GWO method. The obtained results are then compared with others given by available optimization methods in the literature. The outcome of the comparison proved the superiority of the GWO algorithm over other meta-heuristics techniques such as Modified Differential Evolution (MDE), Enhanced Genetic Algorithm (EGA), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Biogeography Based Optimization (BBO), Artificial Bee Algorithm (ABC) and Tree-Seed Algorithm (TSA).",

Propulsion of the interfering mobile device will be implemented using system of the stepper motor, which will be controlled with the help of the microcontroller ATmega 16. In order to deal with the interfering part, it is necessary to design an inverter 12V/4000V and 50-60Hz. The inverter is a supply of the high-powered vacuum tube that generates microwaves; magnetron. Magnetron is used as a source of electromagnetic interference high-frequency acting on targets, which operates in the band of Wi-Fi signal. For example, waves of high-frequency radio damage on-board electronic devices of the UAV, and by the way, we can disable fly of UAV in demarcated areas. The interfering mobile device will be used as a preparation interference and measurement electromagnetic compatibility of electronic military equipment.",

        "Abstract": "To improve the throughput and the outage probability of the Cognitive Radio (CR) inspired system, a novel Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) can be deployed to adapt multiple services in 5G wireless communication. In this scheme, after the reception of the superposition coded symbol with a predefined power allocation factors from the primary source, the relay decodes and forwards with a new superposition coded symbol (i.e. allocating another power factors) to the destination. By employing twin antenna design at the relay, the bandwidth efficiency in such scheme will be improved. Assuming Rayleigh fading channels, the closed-form expressions in terms of throughput and the outage performance are derived. Through numerical results, they showed that the outage performance of the proposed scheme using a Single Antenna (SA) scheme at the relay is better than a Twin Antenna (TA) scheme because SA scheme is not affected by its own antenna interference.",

The binary Golay code is an ECC that can correct any combination of three or fewer random errors over a block of 23 digits. This code can be extended by appending a parity check bit to each codeword. There are several algorithms for constructing of Golay code, but more of them are not comfortable for hardware implementation. In this paper, an efficient hardware architecture is presented for the encoder of both binary Golay code and extended Golay code based on CRC. The proposed Golay code encoder is constructed of three units, which are designed carefully: data path, control unit and conversion unit. The proposed architecture is implemented on FPGA using Xilinx ISE 14.2. The implementation results demonstrate that low latency, high throughput, low area and less complexity are the advantages of this architecture compared to previous architectures. Thus, this hardware module can be used for high-speed digital systems.",

        "Abstract": "The diagnosis of UltraSound (US) medical images is affected due to the presence of speckle noise. This noise degrades the diagnostic quality of US images by reducing small details and edges present in the image.  This paper presents a novel method based on shearlet coefficients modeling of log-transformed US images. Noise-free log-transformed coefficients are modeled as Nakagami distribution and speckle noise coefficients are modeled as Gaussian distribution. Method of Log Cumulants (MoLC) and Method of Moments (MoM) are used for parameter estimation of Nakagami distribution and noise free shearlet coefficients respectively. Then noise free shearlet coefficients are obtained using Maximum a Posteriori (MaP) estimation of noisy coefficients. The experimental results were presented by performing various experiments on synthetic and real US images. Subjective and objective quality assessment of the proposed method is presented and is compared with six other existing methods. The effectiveness of the proposed method over other methods can be seen from the obtained results.",

        "Abstract": "The paper deals with a novel enhanced connection of AC/AC powertrain for Hybrid Electric Vehicles (HEV). The substantial contribution of such a connection is the absence of 4QC auxiliary converter needed for autonomous and hybrid operational modes and its compensation by power-lesser 0x5 matrix converter. The main advantages of a simplified connection are, beside smaller auxiliary converter sizing, also possible better efficiency of the HEV powertrain. So, powertrain operation in autonomous traction accu-battery modes uses direct 0x5 configuration of traction 3x5 MxC matrix converter, and in hybrid modes of Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) and accu-battery uses besides traction 3x5 MxC matrix converter the auxiliary 0x5 matrix converter. Modeling and simulation using Matlab-Simulink environment of traction powertrain configuration in autonomous modes are presented in the paper as well as all simulation experiment results.",

        "Abstract": "Development of electric drive tends to the use of Switched Reluctance Motor (SRM) for their advantages and green technology issues. The SRM takes significant place in development for its simplicity, robust construction, and low cost. Sensorless method can be applied to drive SRM, it is less expansive but has more complexity and limitation. On the other hand, although sensor-based rotor position detection needs a hardware assembled on the shaft, some advantages can be obtained. In this paper, a control strategy for SRM drive with rotary encoder based rotor position detection is proposed, core of the strategy implements digital signal controller. The problem associated with wide range speed and standstill operation can be overcome by this strategy. This is also capable to vary the time to turn the switches on and off by software. The analysis was verified by simulations and experiments.",

The waveforms of the stator current, the currents in two neighbouring rotor bars, the current in the rotor ring and the motor inner torque are presented for each tested condition. The simulated values of some motor parameters are compared to their values from the motor catalogue, the manufacturer’s measurement, or the measurement in our laboratory, respectively. The simulated values of the rotor bar current and the rotor ring current are compared to their values from the scientific literature.

        "Abstract": "The disturbances are the significant issue for the trajectory tracking of mobile robots. Therefore, an adequate control law is presented in this paper and this one is based on Global Terminal Sliding Mode (GTSM) with fuzzy control. This control law aims to guarantee the avoidance of the kinematic disturbances which are injected in the angular and linear velocities, respectively. Moreover, the dynamic model based on exponential reaching law is presented to avoid the uncertainties. The control law provides the asymptotic stability by taking into account the fuzzy rules and Lyapunov theory. Thus, the chattering phenomenon should be avoided. The simulation works prove the robustness of the proposed control law by considering the disturbances function and the robot can follow the desired trajectories.",

This paper proposes a novel method for response modelling of high voltage SF6 circuit breakers, based on artificial neural networks, to provide a means\tof assessing its condition. The proposed method enables a timing response model of the circuit breaker to be developed using trip command parameters. In this paper, an experimental setup is used to perform trip response testing of a three-phase 75 kV circuit breaker. The obtained data is then used to train, validate and test a Bayesian regularised artificial neural network that can predict response times of the breaker for a given set of trip command parameters.",

        "Abstract": "Radar signals are time-varying signals where the signal parameters change over time. For these signals, Quadratic Time-Frequency Distribution (QTFD) offers advantages over classical spectrum estimation in terms of frequency and time resolution but it suffers heavily from cross-terms. In generating accurate Time-Frequency Representation (TFR), a kernel function must be able to suppress cross-terms while maintaining auto-terms energy especially in a non-cooperative environment where the parameters of the actual signal are unknown. Thus, a new signal-dependent QTFD is proposed that adaptively estimates the kernel parameters for a wide class of radar signals. The adaptive procedure, Doppler-Lag Block Searching (DLBS) kernel estimation was developed to serve this purpose. Accurate TFRs produced for all simulated radar signals with Instantaneous Frequency (IF) estimation performance are verified using Monte Carlo simulation meeting the requirements of the Cramer-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) at SNR > 6 dB.",

The Position Estimation (PE) accuracy of an MLAT system depends on several factors, one of which is the choice of reference station used to generate the TDOA estimations for use with the lateration algorithm. Furthermore, the closed-form lateration algorithm is known to introduce bias in the PE process. Thus, a bias analysis and improvement in the PE accuracy of an MLAT system with a reference selection technique is presented in the paper. The analysis is carried out for a square GRS configuration with each GRS equipped with a receiver whose Time of Reception (TOR) error Standard Deviation (SD) is assumed 1 nsec. Monte Carlo simulation result of lateration algorithm with reference selection technique shows a reduction of at least 75% in both the overall PE Mean Square Error (MSE) and bias. Furthermore, the PE Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) obtained by the lateration algorithm is reduced by at least 50% out of which 36% of the reduced PE RMSE is contributed only by the TOR estimation error.",

First, the principle of the DOA estimation method is described for the case of the MUSIC method. This paper also discusses the possibilities of optimizing the position of antenna elements in the NLA configuration, which are performed in analytical solutions and simulations. The simulation results are compared to the analytical results to obtain optimal NLA configurations for determining the signal DOA. Simulation results show that the probability of resolution and accuracy in determining the signal DOA are dependent on the antenna array aperture essentially. Furthermore, the realized NLA configuration was verified by an experimental measurement. The obtained experiment results demonstrate that the applied MUSIC method for NLA configuration is suitable and also highly accurate in determining the signal DOA, which was verified.",

        "Abstract": "A mathematical model of a methane concentration sensor has been developed and studied, which takes into account the use of materials with different optical properties in the channel, spectral and spatial adjustment of the sensor components, losses at modulation and signal processing, as well as scattering and absorption of the optical emission flux in the channel. Taking into account results of modelling and experimental studies of the prototype sensor, confirming the adequacy of the proposed model, types of optoelectronic sensor components, as well as its design parameters with allowable deviations in manufacturing, have been substantiated and selected. The emission losses in the optical channel have been minimized when the informative parameter is maximized, which is absorption of optical emission by the measured methane concentration, by providing the length of the sensor measuring channel not more than 30 mm and the use of light and photodiodes with covering of their sensitive elements with chalcogenide glass. It has been established that the main measurement error of methane concentration with the application of these recommendations is not more than 0.04 vol.% with the regulated value of 0.20 vol.% in the range from 0 to 5 vol.%.",

To incorporate more functions, designs are getting complex, thereby increases leakage power dissipation. Low power design objective requires early exploration and estimation. In this paper, we present the power estimation models for ASIC (Application Specific Integrated Circuit) based designs at the C-level of abstraction. The method includes analysis and extraction of the application specific information from the LLVM (Low-Level Virtual Machine) bit-code; which further applies to train the neural network. The trained model is applied in the estimation of the leakage power. Estimation of design power using our models is compared to the implemented measurement, which demonstrates its accuracy. In addition, the proposed methodology is significantly quicker and abolishes the need of synthesis based exploration.",

        "Abstract": "Potentiostatic electrodeposition conducted at various deposition voltages from lactate-stabilized copper sulfate electrolyte was used for preparation of Cu2O layers for Photoelectrochemical (PEC) production of hydrogen. A novel approach based on an application of light during the electrodeposition is utilized to suppress the potential drop in the Cu2O layer during the potentiostatic deposition. Structures prepared under dark and light on an Ag substrate are analyzed by X-Ray Diffraction analysis (XRD), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Linear Sweep Voltammetry (LSV). It was shown that the application of light increases the deposition rate due to the contribution of the photogenerated carriers. The deposition voltage affects the photoresponse of light deposited structures but causes only a negligible change in dark deposited structures. The light deposited samples exhibited a higher photoresponse for all deposition voltages. The presented study suggests the light potentiostatic electrodeposition as an attractive approach for the preparation of Cu2O structures for cheap and efficient photoelectrochemical water splitting applications.",

        "Abstract": "Recently, Fully-Depleted Silicon on Insulator (FD-SOI) MOSFETs have been accepted as a favourable technology beyond nanometer nodes, and the technique of Recessed-Source/Drain (Re-S/D) has made it more immune in regards of various performance factors. However, the proper selection of Buried-Oxide (BOX) thickness is one of the major challenges in the design of FD-SOI based MOS devices in order to suppress the drain electric penetrations across the BOX interface efficiently. In this work, the effect of BOX thickness on the performance of TMG Re-S/D FD-SOI MOSFET has been presented at 60 nm gate length. The perspective of BOX thickness variation has been analysed on the basis of its surface potential profile and the extraction of the threshold voltage by performing two-dimensional numerical simulations. Moreover, to verify the short channel immunity, the impact of gate length scaling has also been discussed. It is found that the device attains two step-up potential profile with suppressed short channel effects. The outcomes reveal that the Drain Induced Barrier Lowering (DIBL) values are lower among conventional SOI MOSFETs. The device has been designed and simulated by using 2D numerical ATLAS Silvaco TCAD simulator.",

First, a backstepping-sliding mode control for quadrotor is introduced. Moreover, a fuzzy logic system is employed to adapt the unknown switching gains to eliminate the chattering phenomenon induced by switching control on the conventional Backstepping-Sliding Mode Controller (BSMC). The dynamical motion equations are obtained by Euler-Newton formalism. The stability of the system is guaranteed in the sense of the Lyapunov stability theorem. Simulation results are carried out using Matlab/Simulink environment to illustrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed controller.",

It draws on advanced techniques of signal processing based on wavelet transforms, using data sampled from the main feeder current to extract important characteristics and dynamic features of the fault signal. In this method, algorithms designed for fault detection and classification based on features extracted from wavelet transforms were implemented. One of four different algorithms based on ANFIS, according to the type of fault, was then used to locate the fault zone. Studies and simulations in an EMTP-RV environment for the 25kV power distribution system of Canada were carried out by considering ten types of faults with different fault inception, fault resistance and fault locations. The simulation results showed high accuracy in classifying the type of fault and determining the fault area, so that the maximum observed error was less than 2%.",

Motivated by the recent advance in Heterogeneous Network (HetNet) using relaying techniques, we consider the D2D communication provided by Energy Harvesting (EH) assisted relay where signal is forwarded from a Base Station (BS) to the conventional cellular user (non-D2D user) and D2D user. We first derive the outage probability by taking into account the SNR and power allocation parameters, and propose the transmission mode for D2D link as well as non-D2D link. After deriving the outage probability of the D2D-HetNet, we explore the effects of the network parameters on the outage probability and throughput.",

        "Abstract": "A compact gap coupled dual-band patch antenna is proposed for WLAN and WiMAX applications. Two resonating frequencies at 3.6GHz and 5.2GHz with a frequency ratio of 1.40 (theoretical), 1.45 (simulated) and 1.48 (measured) are observed. The frequency ratio depends on the thickness of substrate and gap length between the fed and parasitic patches. The impedance bandwidth at lower resonant frequency is 23.7% (theoretical), 3.9% (simulated) and 8.7% (measured) and at upper resonant frequency it is 23.5% (theoretical), 4% (simulated) and 9.2% (measured). Simulated gain of the patch antenna is 1.6dBi at lower resonant frequency and 4.2 dBi at upper resonant frequency. Voltage Standing Wave Ratio (VSWR) remains below 1.2. The electric and magnetic field radiation patterns at both the resonating frequencies clearly depict that the co-polarization is higher than the cross polarization. Experimental return loss (|S_11|), VSWR, input impedance and group delay are in close agreement with theoretical and simulated (by High Frequency Structure Simulator (HFSS) Software) results.",

        "Abstract": "To be able to use robots of the same type in a swarm (in this case differential-drive robots) from a centralized computer, you need to control them in the same way even if the robots come from different manu\\-facturers. These robots should have the same capabilities: i.e. the same type of sensors and the same type of control commands. Currently, if we need to add sensors on a robot, we should first find out what are the hardware capabilities and what are the tools provided by the manufacturer (some have microcontrollers, others have ARM processors). The protocol to communicate with the onboard card (often a serial protocol) is different for each robot and we have to take that in account in our software so that the robots can be interchangeable.  \r\nThis paper describes the design and the results of using a standard interface (bridge) on a robot which allows wireless communication with a centralized computer and local serial communication with a mobile robot. On this interface, we can connect every sensor we want (infrared, ultrasound, laser, Kinect etc.) and we can always use the same tools to control them.\r\nExtension of the protocol of the Kobuki base (TurtleBot2) is proposed to be able to use the same type of frame as the TurtleBot 2 uses and to continue to use ROS middleware as is, but with the possibility to use data from new sensors implemented on the bridge. This article will focus on the use of the TurtleBot 2, but the same bridge will be adapted  to other robots allowing their interchangeability in the future.",

        "Abstract": "Electric drainage is a power electronic device used to protect underground metal devices (such as piping) from the corrosive effects of stray currents. Stray currents are usually caused by DC electric traction, such as trams or railways. In places where stray currents leave the underground device and return into rails, they cause significant electrochemical corrosion of buried devices. The principle of electric drainage is based on electrical connection between the underground device and electric traction rails, which ensures that current flows through this connection, instead of flowing into the ground. Nowadays, the most widely used type is regulated electric drainage, where current is regulated by means of Pulse Width Modulation (PWM). Because of this modulation, current flowing through the drainage contains harmonic components with different frequencies. In modern railways, track circuits are often used as an important part of the track security system. For safe operation, it is necessary to ensure that frequencies generated by the drainage do not interfere with track circuits. This paper describes the design of a regulated drainage control system, with regard to its compatibility with track circuits and this paper contains related computer simulations and discussion of the results",

This ratio is calculated in order to estimate the traction vehicle speed and the distance at which the track occupancy can be indicated. Therefore, the impedance moduli and the impedance phases of the open track circuit and the impedance of the occupied track (short-circuit impedance) is compared at different short-circuit distances. The impedances ratio varies with changing weather conditions. It is different in dry weather than in the rain. Therefore, in practical use, the track occupancy indicator must always be updated and the ratio must always be recalculated for the new situation. In this paper, the impedances ratio is calculated for specific parameters measured in the section of the track in Orlova. The distance between a reference point (place of short circuit rails) from a measuring point is for the impedance module ratio of F = 10 about 218 m.",

        "Abstract": "Among other aspects, the reliability of electricity meters is important for securing energy supply and other Smart Grid (SG) functions and services. This paper analyses the reliability of functions and services provided by electricity meters in relation to reliability of individual electricity meters and their components. The increasing reliability requirements lead to higher complexity and manufacturing cost of electricity meter. On the other hand, purchase price pressure may cause increased failure rate of an individual meter, drop in overall reliability of SG environment, and finally can increase operating costs. Thus, Total Cost of smart meter Ownership (TCO) is associated with the failure rate (reliability). While seeking optimal TCO/reliability ratio, a contribution of each individual component to the overall failure rate of an electricity meter was investigated. Expected development of selected components reliability parameters and its influence on failure rate of meter and metering system was also estimated.",

The first structure was prepared from IP-Dip polymer and used for modification of the radiation pattern of the optical fiber. The second PhC structure was filled with liquid polymer PolyDiMethylSiloxane (PDMS) and directly placed on the LED chip. Quality of the prepared structures was confirmed by a confocal microscope. The modification of the far-field radiation patterns of LED and optical fiber was measured by a goniophotometer.",

        "Abstract": "Nowadays, Cu_2O is very promising electrode material for photoelectrochemical applications. In this paper, we report on the controllable synthesis of Cu_2O single particles as well as compact layers on Boron Doped Diamond (BDD) electrodes using potentiostatic deposition in continuous and pulse mode. The BDD layers were prepared with different B/C ratios in the gas phase in order to investigate boron doping level influence on the Cu_2O properties. The effect of electrodeposition conditions such as deposition regime and pulse duration was investigated as well. The Cu_2O covered BDD electrodes were analysed by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Raman spectroscopy. Improvement in the homogeneity of the electrodeposit and removal of clusters were achieved when the pulse potentiostatic regime was used. Using the same pulse electrodeposition parameters, we confirmed the possibility of controlling the deposition rate of Cu_2O by varying the BDD conductivity. Finally, we were able to scale the size of Cu_2O particles by changing the number of deposition pulses. The obtained results have shown a great potential of controlling the morphology, amount, size and distribution of Cu_2O films on BDD substrates by changing the boron doping level and electrodeposition conditions as well. The investigations reported herein allowed us to better understand the deposition mechanism of Cu_2O on BDD electrodes which could then be used for preparation of active layers for electrochemical applications and in optoelectronic devices such as solar cells and photodetectors.",

Moreover, applied acceleration voltage changes the volume of Backscattered Electrons (BSE) participation in total energy absorption in resist layers. Proper estimation of energy distribution in used materials, due to electron scattering, is the key in final resist profile calculation and critical parameter in the designing process of the lithography exposure. In the presented paper, the Monte Carlo (MC) simulations of electron beam influence on lithographic system, consisting of positive tone resists (PMMA/MA and CSAR-62) spin coated on different substrates, will be presented. For high accuracy, obtained point spread functions were modelled by double-Gaussian function for Si, GaAs, AlGaN/GaN and InP substrates, respectively. Extracted scattering parameters of forward and backward electrons will be shown and their differences will be discussed. Results of simulated and conducted process of 100 nm metallic path fabrication on mentioned materials will be presented and compared. The practical usage of EBL technique will be shown in the aspect off low resolution application in low energy range of primary electron beam.",

        "Abstract": "This paper focuses on speed and current sensor Faults Detection and Isolation (FDI) in an Induction Motor (IM) drive. The effect of sensors faults on the IM vector control is presented, then, new detection and isolation approaches are suggested. Speed sensor faults are detected when an error between only two points from speed data exceeds a certain threshold. An algorithm based on RMS currents is developed to detect and isolate any faulty current sensor. This requires three current sensors, each per phase. Besides, open circuit faults of inverter power switches are taken into account too. To ensure continuous functionality of the drive, we conceived an Active Fault Tolerant Controller (AFTC) with smoother reconfiguration feature. Simulations in Matlab/Simulink are carried out to show the efficiency of the suggested schemes.",

Out of these DG systems, the PV systems have gained wide popularity, because of the availability of solar energy throughout the day. Depending on the size of PV installations, a large number of PV modules can be interconnected in the form of series and parallel connection. Since a large number of modules are interconnected, it is possible for the faults in a PV array to occur due to the failure of protection system, which can cause damage to the PV module and also the decrease in the output power. This paper presents the tracking of a maximum power point under the faulty conditions of 12x5 PV array. The fault conditions that have been considered in the PV array are open circuit fault, line to ground, line to line and failure of bypass diodes. Perturb and observe, incremental conductance and fuzzy logic controller are the maximum power point tracking techniques that have been implemented. For each of the fault conditions, the results have been presented in terms of the maximum power tracked, tracking time and tracking efficiency.",

        "Abstract": "The proposed paper presents a simple and particularly efficacious Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) algorithm based on Silver Mean Method (SMM). This method operates by choosing a search interval from the P-V characteristics of the given solar array and converges to MPP of the Solar Photo-Voltaic (SPV) system by shrinking its interval. After achieving the maximum power, the algorithm stops shrinking and maintains constant voltage until the next interval is decided. The tracking capability efficiency and performance analysis of the proposed algorithm are validated  by the simulation and experimental results with a 100W solar panel for variable temperature and irradiance conditions. The results obtained confirm that even without any perturbation and observation process, the proposed method still outperforms the traditional perturb and observe (P&O) method by demonstrating far better steady state output, more accuracy and higher efficiency.",

The proposed DVR control method is modelled using MATLAB-Simulink. It is tested using balanced/unbalanced voltage sags as well as fluctuant and distorted voltages. As a result, by using this controlling method, the dynamic characteristics of the system have been improved significantly. The system performed with higher accuracy, faster response and lower distortion in the voltage sags compensation.

        "Abstract": "Because of increased number of sensitive loads and automated processes in industry, need for high quality power is nowadays inevitable. Deteriorated power quality my result in huge financial losses and also decreases the productivity. The power electronic based solutions for improving power quality have become more common in the recent years. One of these solutions is to use the Dynamic Voltage Restorer (DVR), which is a series-connected voltage compensator. Interline DVR (IDVR) is a special structure, in which two DVRs share a DC-link. These two DVRs are installed in two independent distribution feeders which may have two different voltage levels. In this paper, a new structure for IDVR is proposed. The proposed DVR is based on the multilevel converters. Therefore, we call it as Multilevel Converter based IDVR (MLC-IDVR). Because of using multilevel converter, the quality of voltage waveform in the proposed structure is improved in comparison with the conventional IDVR. Also, it is more suitable for higher voltage applications. The performance of the proposed MLC-IDVR is verified by simulation results carried out by PSCAD/EMTDC software.",

        "Abstract": "This paper examines the influence of Static Synchronous Series Compensator (SSSC) on the oscillation damping control in the network. The performance of Flexible AC Transmission System (FACTS) controller highly depends upon its parameters and appropriate location in the network. A new Adaptive Inertia Weight Particle Swarm Optimization (AIWPSO) method is employed to design the parameters of the SSSC-base controller. In the proposed controller, the proper signal of the power system such as rotor angle is used as the feedback. AIWPSO technique has high flexibility and balanced mechanism for the local and global research. The proposed controller is compared with a Genetic Algorithm (GA) based controller that confirms the operation of the controller. To show the integrity of the proposed controller method, the achievement of the simulations is done out in a single-machine infinite-bus and multi-machine grid under multi turmoil.",

This paper introduces a novel effective controller method for simultaneous compensation of both voltage sag/swell and voltage harmonics by using multifunctional dynamic voltage restorer. In proposed controller method called FFT with integrated ISRF, ISRF detects the magnitudes of voltage sag/swell quickly and precisely, and FFT extracts the selective components of voltage harmonics very effectively. The proposed method integrates the superior properties of ISRF and FFT methods. FFT integrated ISRF is applied for the first time to provide the compensation of both sag/swell and selective harmonics together. The proposed system has ability to compensate symmetrical/asymmetrical sag/swell and symmetrical/asymmetrical selective harmonics which are 5th, 7th, 11th and 13th. The controlled system is modelled in PSCAD/EMDTC and compared with conventional methods. The performance results verify that the proposed method compensates voltage disturbances effectively in the system.",

        "Abstract": "The control of power converter devices is one of the main research lines in interfaced renewable energy sources, such as solar cells and wind turbines. Therefore, suitable control algorithms should be designed in order to regulate power or current properly and attain a good power quality for some disturbances, such as voltage sag/swell, voltage unbalances and fluctuations, long interruptions, and harmonics. Various synchronisation techniques based control strategies are implemented for the hybrid power system applications under unbalanced conditions in literature studies. In this paper, synchronisation algorithms based Proportional-Resonant (PR) power/current controller is applied to the hybrid power system (solar cell + wind turbine + grid), and Dual Second Order Generalized Integrator-Phase Locked Loop (DSOGI-PLL) based PR controller in stationary reference frame provides a solution to overcome these problems. The influence of various cases, such as unbalance, and harmonic conditions, is examined, analysed and compared to the PR controllers based on DSOGI-PLL and SRF-PLL. The results verify the effectiveness and correctness of the proposed DSOGI-PLL based power control method.",

The most detrimental consequence is the premature aging or even failure of the in-service power distribution transformers from industrial facilities (originally designed to cope with the linear loads). Accordingly, the paper quantitatively examines the major thermal operating parameters of these transformers and predicts their lifetime expectancy under a certain harmonic load spectrum. The developed computation principle is based on the international standard recommendations and only demands the load current harmonic content (measured with a power quality analyzer) and the transformer rated data. The study is also carried out on a 250 kVA oil-type three-phase power distribution transformer from a pumping station.",

The biological effects of generated and real telecommunication signals produced by different types of exposure systems are discussed. However, the proper exposure methods for such experiments are very limited. We successfully developed a simple and cost-effective exposure unit with real GSM/DCS/UMTS signal from BTS containing proper modulations or intermittence (continuous, interrupted). Signal processing and conditioning unit is based on a Radiofrequency (RF) repeater. The downlink signal is filtered by integrated high selectivity passband filters and amplified to a required level. The main part of exposure unit is a Faraday cage with the specimen (exposure) area measuring 150 x 250 mm with E-field percent deviation less than 18%. This exposure system can be helpful in experiments with living organisms in in vivo studies and in vitro studies with normal or pathological cells and other micro scale structures being exposed to RF EM fields from BTS.",

In the paper we solve influence of real OPA properties. Theoretical considerations are verified by means of simulations (MicroCap) and experiments.

Authors compare two types of features - Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) and Local Binary Patterns (LBP) including their combination. These parameters are classified using Multilayer Neural Network (MLNN) and Support Vector Machines (SVM). Face authentication consists of several steps. The first step contains Viola-Jones algorithm for face detection. Authors resize the detected face for a fixed vector and afterwards, it is converted into grayscale. Next, feature extraction with a simple Min-Max normalization is applied. Obtained parameters are evaluated by classifiers and for each detected face, authors get posterior probability as the output of the classifier. Different approaches for face authentication are compared with each other using False Acceptance Rate (FAR), False Rejection Rate (FRR), Equal Error Rate (EER), Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) and Detection Error Tradeoff (DET) curves. The results are verified with AR Face Database and elaborated in a feature extraction and classifier design point of view. Best results were achieved by HOG feature for SVM classifier. Detailed results are listed in the text below.",

The certifying origin and content of digital images is an open problem in the multimedia world. One of the ways to find the truth of images is finding the presence of any type of contrast enhancement. In this work, novel and simple machine learning tool is proposed to detect the presence of histogram equalization using statistical parameters of DC Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) coefficients. The statistical parameters of the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) fitted to DC DCT coefficients are used as features for classifying original and histogram equalized images. An SVM classifier has been developed to classify original and histogram equalized image which can detect histogram equalized image with accuracy greater than 95% when false rate is less than 5%.",

The OPF problem of pure AC power systems considers the minimization of total costs under equality and inequality constraints. Hence, the OPF problem of integrated AC-DC power systems is extended to incorporate HVDC links, while taking into consideration the power transfer control characteristics using a GWO algorithm. This algorithm is inspired by the hunting behavior and social leadership of grey wolves in nature. The proposed algorithm is applied to two different case-studies: the modified 5-bus and WSCC 9-bus test systems. The validity of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated by comparing the obtained results with those reported in literature using other optimization techniques. Analysis of the obtained results show that the proposed GWO algorithm is able to achieve shorter CPU time, as well as minimized total cost when compared with already existing optimization techniques. This conclusion proves the efficiency of the GWO algorithm.",

        "Abstract": "This paper presents the Congestion Management (CM) methodologies and how they get modified in the new competitive framework of electricity power markets. When the load on the system is increased or when some contingency occurs in the system, some of the lines may become overloaded. Thus, the loadability of the system should be increased by generating and dispatching the power optimally for the secure operation of power system. In this paper, the CM problem is solved by using the optimal rescheduling of generating units and load demands, and the Swarm intelligent techniques are used to handle this problem. Here, the CM problem is solved by using the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Fitness Distance Ratio PSO (FDR-PSO) and Fuzzy Adaptive-PSO (FA-PSO). First, the generating units are selected based on sensitivity to the over-loaded transmission line, and then these generators are rescheduled to remove the congestion in the transmission line. This paper also utilizes the demand response offers to solve the CM problem. The effectiveness of the proposed CM methodology is examined on the IEEE 30 bus and Indian 75 bus test systems.",

        "Abstract": "This paper proposes an approach based on the Symbiotic Organism Search (SOS) for optimal determining sizing, siting, and number of Distributed Generations (DG) in distribution systems. The objective of the problem is to minimize the power loss of the system subject to the equality and inequality constraints such as power balance, bus voltage limits, DG capacity limits, and DG penetration limit. The SOS approach is defined as the symbiotic relationship observed between two organisms in an ecosystem, which does not need the control parameters like other meta-heuristic algorithms in the literature. For the implementation of the proposed method to the problem, an integrated approach of Loss Sensitivity Factor (LSF) is used to determine the optimal location for installation of DG units, and SOS is used to find the optimal size of DG units. The proposed method has been tested on IEEE 33-bus, 69-bus, and 118-bus radial distribution systems. The obtained results from the SOS algorithm have been compared to those of other methods in the literature. The simulated results have demonstrated that the proposed SOS method has a very good performance and effectiveness for the problem of optimal placement of DG units in distribution systems.",

        "Abstract": "In the few last decades, Distribution Generation (DG) has drawn a great attention by researchers around the world in the field of Radial Distributed Systems (RDSs). Generally, the optimal placement is based on the maximization of the Voltage Stability Index (VSI) and the optimal sizing is based on the minimization of the Total Active Power Losses (TAPLs). Hence, a Multi-Objective Optimization Problem (MOOP) is proposed to achieve the both mentioned objectives. For this purpose, a new simple optimization algorithm known as Bat Algorithm (BA) based on Weight Sum Method (WSM) has been used to resolve the MOOP. Then, the Fuzzy Based (FB) technique is employed to find the Best Compromise Solution.  This paper also provides a comparison between the proposed algorithm and other recently published methods. From the obtained results, the advantage of the proposed algorithm is clearly observed from multiple points of view such as enhancement of Voltage Profile (VP), decreasing of the TAPL, and the maximization of the VSI. The investigations have been carried out on a standard IEEE 12-bus, 33-bus, 69-bus, and 85-bus test feeders.",

In addition, the robustness of control and observer algorithms are also proved by Lyapunov’s criterion. The experiments are obtained in different speed changes of an induction motor drive. These experimental results confirm the dynamic properties of a sensorless sliding mode control of an induction motor drive.",

Stray currents occur in the vicinity of a railway platform during the passage of a railway vehicle. In a fault-free state, all metallic parts are separated from the rail by means of a surge arrester. In the case of a breakdown of the surge arrester, the full voltage which is on the rail at the time of the passing railway vehicle may also pass onto the metallic parts. The surge arresters are checked every 6 months during maintenance work on the overhead lines according to Annex No. 1 of SZDC internal regulation E 500.\r\nThe article, therefore, carries out a simulation of stray currents in exactly this type of breakdown. In addition, to the model, we included the influence of the outdoor lighting cable which is located in the ground under the platform. For the purposes of solving the model, we are using a commercially available program which solves partial differential equations and uses the finite element method for calculation.",

        "Abstract": "Due to conventional differential evolution algorithm is often trapped in local optima and premature convergence in high dimensional optimization problems, a State Evaluation Adaptive Differential Evolution algorithm (SEADE) is proposed in this paper. By using independent scale factor on each dimension of optimization problem, and evaluating the distribution of population on each dimension, the SEADE correct the control parameters adaptively. External archive and a moving window evaluation mechanism on evolution state are introduced in SEADE to detect whether the evolution is stagnation or not, and with the help of opposition-based population, the algorithm can jump out of local optima basins. The results of experiments on several benchmarks show that the proposed algorithm is capable of improving the search performance of high dimensional optimization problems. And it is more efficient in design FIR digital filter using SEADE than conventional method like Parks-McClellan algorithm.",

        "Abstract": "A novel topology of four-quadrant analog multiplier circuit is presented in this paper. The voltage mode technique is employed to design the circuit in CMOS technology. The dynamic input and output ranges of the circuit are improved owing to the fact that the circuit works in the saturation region not in weak inversion. Also the proposed multiplier is suitable for low voltage operation and its power consumption is relatively low. In order to verify the performance of the proposed circuit, performance of the circuit affected by second order effects including transistor mismatch and mobility reduction is analyzed in detail. It will be shown that any conceivable mismatch in the transistor parameters leads to second harmonic distortion. Additionally, the effect of mobility reduction in the third harmonic distortion will be computed. In order to simulate the circuit, Cadence and HSPICE software are used with TSMC level 49 (BSIM3v3) parameters for 0.18 μm CMOS technology, where under supply voltage of 1.5 V, total power consumption is 44 µW, the corresponding average nonlinearity remains as low as 1 %, and the input range of the circuit is ± 400 mV.",

The hysteresis of the proposed circuit is generated using cross-coupled pMOS or nMOS transistors, which can be tuned by engineering cross-coupled transistors current. By changing input voltage, the hysteresis window can also be adequately adjusted. Negative feedback has been introduced through CMOS differential amplifier which makes the circuit less sensitive to process, supply voltage and temperature (PVT) deviations. The proposed configuration uses TSMC 0.18 µm CMOS technology with 1.8V supply voltage. Simulation results show that the switching voltage of the circuit can be tuned for target applications.",

The utilization of only grounded passive components makes this circuit a better choice for integrated circuit implementation. The current mode biquadratic filter offers all the five basic responses along with independent tunability of its quality factor. The dual-mode quadrature sinusoidal oscillator offers explicit current outputs along with voltage outputs. The circuit also offers a simple and uncoupled condition of oscillation and frequency of oscillation. The typical analysis such as non-ideal, sensitivity and parasitic analysis along with the regular simulation results as well as experimental results are exposed here, to strengthen the design idea.",

To the best knowledge of the authors, any inverse filter configuration using OTRAs has not been reported in the literature earlier. The effect of the major parasitics of the OTRAs and their effect on the performance filter have been investigated and measured through simulation results and Monte-Carlo analysis. The workability of the proposed circuits has been confirmed by SPICE simulations using CMOS-based-OTRA realizable in 0.18 µm CMOS technology. The proposed circuits are the only ones which provide simultaneously the following features: use of reasonable number of active elements (only 2), realizability of all the three basic filter functions, employment of all virtually grounded resistors and capacitors and tunability of all filter parameters (except gain factor, H_0 for inverse high pass).\r\nThe centre/cut-off frequency of the various filter circuits lying in the vicinity of 1 MHz have been found to be realizable, which has been verified through SPICE simulation results and have been found to be in good agreement with the theoretical results.",

Speckle noise reduces the fine details present in the images and hence make it more difficult to diagnose. In this paper, a~novel method based on the combination of three spatial domain filters is presented. The output of these filters is combined on the basis of an Intensity Classifier Map (ICF) formed using Coefficient of Dispersion (CoD) parameter. Experiments were conducted on synthetic and real US images. Quantitative and qualitative analysis of the proposed method is carried out in comparison to other six existing methods. It has been found from the obtained results that proposed method delivers observable improvement in all quantitative parameters undertaken for synthetic US image and in MVR value for real US images. Also, the effectiveness of the proposed method is found to be consistent with qualitative assessment of the denoised images.",

        "Abstract": "In this paper, we investigate optical network recommendations GPON and XG-PON with triple-play services in terms of physical reach, number of subscribers, transceiver design, modulation format and implementation cost. Despite of trends to increase the bit rate from 2.5 Gbps to 10 Gbps and beyond, TDM-PONs cannot cope with bandwidth requirements of future networks. TDM and WDM techniques can be combined, resulting in improved scalability. Longer physical reach can be achieved by deploying active network elements within the transmission path. We investigate these options by considering their potential coexistence at the physical layer. Subsequently, we analyse the upgrade of optical channels to 100 Gbps and 256 Gbps by using advanced modulation formats, which combine polarization division multiplexing with coherent detection and digital signal processing. We show that PDM-QPSK format is suitable for 100 Gbps systems and PDM-16QAM is more beneficial at 256 Gbps. Simulations are performed in the OptSim software environment.",

The aim of this study was to determine the sensitivity of a polarization maintaining fiber to the radiating heat, and to upgrade the space configuration and time response when using the 635 nm light. The sensitivity of the polarization maintaining fiber during excitation of both polarization modes is the principle of this sensor function. This excitation is caused by temperature change and by absorption of thermal radiation. This mechanism is used as an indicator for detection of temperature field disturbance. This article also provides links to previously published results and compares them to the results in this article.",

By mixing the LaTb green phosphor and the YAG:Ce yellow phosphor compounding under condition of 7000 K MCW-LEDs, this new approach can produce a huge meaningful change in lumen output and the angular color distribution of MCW-LEDs. We also study the interaction between the concentration and size of the LaTb particles with output flux, color uniformity, CRI, and CQS. The obtained results demonstrate that the higher lumen output, the higher color uniformity enhancement could be attained by adding the LaTb particles with a size range around 6-8 µm and the concentration around 1.5% in phosphor layer. Meanwhile, the decrease of the color rendering value (CRI) and the Color Quality Scale (CQS) tend to be stable and insignificant. In other words, the obtained results provide a prospective method which plays an important role in the development of MCW-LED manufacturing technology.",

A best relay is selected based on end-to-end signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratios (SINRs) in both Amplify-and-Forward (called an EHAF protocol) and Decode-and-Forward (called an EHDF protocol) cooperation methods. We analyze and evaluate the system performance in terms of exact closed-form throughputs over Rayleigh fading channels. Simulation and analysis results discover contributions as follows. Firstly, the throughput performance of the proposed protocols EHAF and EHDF is improved when comparing with that of a non-selection cooperation scheme. Secondly, the EHDF protocol is more efficient than the EHAF protocol. Finally, the theoretical analyses are validated by performing Monte Carlo simulations.",

In the proposed protocol, a source attempts to transmit its data to a destination with assistance of multiple intermediate relays. From the eavesdropping Channel State Information (CSI) estimated, the source and relays adjust their transmit power so that the eavesdropper cannot overhear the transmitted data. Moreover, to enhance throughput for the proposed system, Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) technique with a simple power allocation is also proposed. We derive exact closed-form expressions of the Outage Probability (OP) and throughput for the data transmission over Rayleigh fading channel. In addition, when the CSI estimation is imperfect, Intercept Probability (IP) at the eavesdropper is derived. Finally, Monte Carlo simulations are presented to verify the theoretical derivations.",

The proposed methodology, based on multi-criteria information utility assessment process, is designed. The heterogeneous context awareness data collection subsystems integration is enabled by transforming the acquired data to the highly dynamic intelligent transport systems. Each element of this intellectual transport system runs as a separate component having a specific environmental monitoring and control elements. Evaluation of context information utility allowed realizing the methods and algorithms that adaptively reduce the load on the wireless channel, and the transmitted and stored data volume without losing the enriched contextual information quality, which allows developing more complex heterogeneous services. It is believed that the obtained scientific results will have positive effect for the future research and development of context awareness and service adaptation systems.",

These networks are mobile networks, where mobile devices are carried by humans. For simulation purposes, it is useful if mobility models designed to evaluate and tests performance of routing protocols are using mobility patterns and behaviour of humans. For these reasons, Students Social Based Mobility Model (SSBMM) was proposed as simulation tool with social mobility of nodes. To prove that SSBMM is really using social behaviour of nodes, Metrics for Evaluation of Social Behaviour in Mobility Models was designed. These metrics were adapted to the mobility of nodes in order to be able to reveal if the mobility of nodes in used mobility models is social. The performed simulations prove deviation of SSBMM from random mobility models. Described metrics reveal that SSBMM has strong social ties among nodes in comparison with random mobility models.",

The information capacity of the backhaul part of the communication network will be continuously increased as a result of Smart Grid services expanding. In this paper, the data rate analysis of the backhaul links on medium-voltage power grid level is presented. The network model and calculation of aggregate data rate method for the medium-voltage section is designed. In next part, the experimental results of broadband power line communication are presented and these results are compared with aggregated data transmission requirements. Usability of broadband power line communication is discussed and gradual transition to optic fibre communications is predicted.",

The depth-based human detection method is fast but less accurate. On the other hand, the faster region convolutional neural network-based human detection method is accurate but requires a rather complex hardware configuration. To simultaneously leverage the advantages and relieve the drawbacks of each method, one master and one client system is proposed. The final goal is to make a novel Robot Operation System (ROS)-based Perception Sensor Network (PSN) system, which is more accurate and ready for the real time application. The experimental results demonstrate the outperforming of the proposed method compared with other conventional methods in the challenging scenarios.",

        "Abstract": "In hyperspectral classification, a derivative of reflectance spectra is used directly or by fusion with the reflectance spectra. In this way, classification performance is improved. However, on the land cover, especially for plant species, the reflectance spectra may exhibit differences depending on a plant age and maturity level. This situation makes traditional classification methods which are based on time-dependent spectral similarity. In addition, the problem of classification of the species which have similar spectral properties is still valid. As a solution to time dependency and spectral similarity problems, in this study, a new and more generic method based on the spectral derivative is proposed. The method is tested for hyperspectral images which are captured at different time of the year and different places, in the life cycle of species. Test results show that proposed method successfully classifies the land cover time-independent and it is superior to the classical classification methods.",

In our experiments, the overall recognition accuracy of the PCA, LBPH, KNN and proposed CNN is demonstrated. All the experiments were implemented on the ORL database and the obtained experimental results were shown and evaluated. This face database consists of 400 different subjects (40 classes/ 10 images for each class). The experimental result shows that the LBPH provide better results than PCA and KNN. These experimental results on the ORL database demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method for face recognition. For proposed CNN we have obtained a best recognition accuracy of 98.3 %. The proposed method based on CNN outperforms the state of the art methods.",

Compression efficiency of H.264 and H.265 codecs defined by different Constant rate factor (CRF) values was tested. The assessment was done for eight types of video sequences depending on content for High Definition (HD), Full HD (FHD) and Ultra HD (UHD) resolution. Finally, performance of both mentioned codecs with emphasis on compression ratio and efficiency of coding was compared.",

To achieve this goal, eight video sequences, each representing a different content prototype, were analysed. Subjective evaluation was performed using the ACR method. The analysed video sequences were encoded to 8 and 10-bit bit depth. Two most used compression standards H.264 and H.265 were evaluated with 1, 3, 5, 10 and 15 Mbps bitrate in Full HD and UHD resolution. Finally, the perceived quality of both compression standards using the subjective tests with emphasis on bit-depth was compared. From the results we can state, that the practical application of 10-bit bit depth is not appropriate for Full HD resolution in the range of bitrate from 1 to 15 Mbps, for Ultra HD resolution, it is appropriate only for videos encoded by H.265/HEVC compression standard.",

The evaluation was done for two most used video codecs H.264/AVC and H.265/HEVC. Eight types of video sequences with Full HD and Ultra HD resolutions depending on content were tested. The experimental results showed that observers did not see the difference between unsubsampled and subsampled sequences, so using subsampled videos is preferable even 50 % of the amount of data can be saved. Also, the minimum bitrates to achieve the good and fair quality by each codec and resolution were determined.",
